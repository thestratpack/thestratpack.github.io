First up, faced with a weekend without any football or motorsport, I took a Saturday morning trip to see Wes Anderson’s new picture, &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asteroid-city_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll start with the easy part: Wes Anderson films are always beautiful to look at. &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; is no exception, and its setting - a dusty town in the Nevada desert - plays a helping hand in making the film’s aesthetic memorable, with the juxtaposition of orange dust and blue sky, split by the horizon, dominating most frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The director’s knack for composition also returns. Almost every shot could be a painting, and as in all of Anderson’s films, mise en scene is used to great effect, with little clues and details dotted around for the keen-eyed viewer to spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot revolves around a competition hosted in the town, which sees a group of talented and very geeky kids demonstrate their impressive scientific inventions in a bid to win a $5,000 prize from the US military. All is derailed when an alien visits (he’s animated in &lt;em&gt;Isle of Dogs&lt;/em&gt;-style stop motion, if you were wondering), and the characters must deal with subsequent quarantine in the middle of nowhere.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening reveals that &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; is actually a film about a play of the same name, and between scenes we see glimpses of the author’s life, casting for the show, and the actors’ behind-the-scenes tribulations, usually narrated on-screen by Bryan Cranston. This serves as a way for Anderson to explain certain aspects of the film, and eventually seeps into the main production, with people showing up in the wrong scenes or questioning their stage characters’ motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this is a star-studded film, with everybody from Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson to Edward Norton and Jeff Goldblum popping up. As a Hanks fan, I was a little disappointed he didn’t have more to do, but it was Jason Schwartzman who stood out in the shoes of a war photographer forced to break the news of his wife’s death to his children in a way that was somehow both touching and comedic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all interesting and entertaining enough, but with several in-universe subplots as well as the overarching dual plot, I was left questioning what &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; was actually &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn’t a film about an alien visit, because the sci-fi angle wasn’t ever explored in any detail. You could argue it was about loss, especially considering the mantra repeated towards the end, but in the main story Schwartzman’s character quickly moved on and his girls’ reactions were mainly played for comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the timing of production and release, when the word “quarantine” started to be thrown around I thought it may even turn out to be about the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, but I struggled to draw many more parallels there, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fictional author of &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt;, played by Norton, says his play is about “infinity”, suggesting more of an extra-terrestrial focus, and there are a few questions posed in this respect. Where did the alien come from and where did he go? What was the motive for his visit to Earth? And once word gets out and the wider public knows there is life out there, will the world change in irreversible ways?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that these questions are asked too late, are primarily treated as rhetorical, and receive little screen time in a film cluttered with a myriad of side stories across two main plots. &lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; is never dull - it’s carried along nicely by stylish aesthetics, solid performances, and memorable exchanges that demonstrate its contributors’ mastery of the medium - but it flits between so many characters and themes that for me it never got going as well as Anderson’s previous films.&lt;/p&gt;

This is another post that sits somewhere between the review and retrospective categories, but like others in the series, this is a remarkable game that deserves discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yakuza-6_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in 2016, &lt;em&gt;The Song of Life&lt;/em&gt; was the seventh mainline game in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series (the numbering was thrown off by the 2015 prequel &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, which I’ll likely revisit in a future article). It follows the traditional series main character Kazuma Kiryu as he investigates a personal mystery that takes him on a journey across Japan and is revealed to be linked to his yakuza past in Kamurocho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friends-and-foes&quot;&gt;Friends and foes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first picked up the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series, I thought the story would consist of Japanese men in suits sitting around in dark rooms discussing who’s on whose turf. While there is a fair amount of that, &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/em&gt; takes a much more personal approach, with a story exploring the bonds between family and friends.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just come out of prison, Kiryu finds that his adoptive niece Haruka has gone missing from the Okinawa ophanage they run togther. He heads back to Tokyo to search for her, but finds the Chinese mafia has invaded his turf while he was away. Disorientated, he follows the only lead he has and sets off to Hiroshima prefecture to retrace her last known steps and uncover clues as to her whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yakuza-6_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hiroshima sections have a summer holiday feel. Kiryu is dropped into an unfamiliar town with a few friends, a rival, and a potential love interest, and for some time you spend your days playing baseball and frequenting the local bar. The local yakuza - played by real life actors, headed by Takeshi Kitano - are the real stars, and transform from antagonists, to jesters, to brothers over the course of 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiryu eventually learns that Haruka was hit by a car in Kamurocho and is in a coma. Perhaps a bigger shock is that she has a baby son, Haruto, who he takes into his care. The rest of the story unravels the mystery of what Haruka was up to and who Haruto’s father is, and - surprise, surprise - it turns out that it’s all entwined with the gangs’ tussle over the red light district and an 80-year old secret in Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is intriguing, but feels a couple of hours too long, with lengthy flashback cutscenes that went on for hours after the characters I cared most about were relegated to the background. It kept feeling that everything was going to wrap nicely, before introducing another layer of conspiracy and double-crossing to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yakuza-6_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this could be seen as a brave move, with the game continuing beyond where most would leave off, into a kind of epilogue where the characters face consequences for their actions. &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;’s writing is expert at painting people as the bad guys, only to show their humanity in the most heartwrenching ways, and the finale is heartbreaking (even if it does undermine its own impact somewhat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-shades-of-kiryu&quot;&gt;Two shades of Kiryu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always like the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games as a little slice of Japan. By that I don’t mean that I think real Yakuza are huge guys wearing loud suits - I mean that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio captures the atmosphere really well, right down to small details like the combinis and the real drinks in the vending machines. It might sound weird, but there were some points at which locations in the game evoked such strong memories of places I’ve visited in &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; that I could almost smell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the gameplay is somewhat divorced from the story. In cutscenes, Kiryu is portrayed as a kind, gentle man who looks after orphans, but he spends most of the game delivering brutal beatdowns at the drop of a hat. Most of the main story missions involve him trying to get somewhere before a large group of threatening men block his way. Invariably, he yells something and they fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yakuza-6_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the combat has more depth than I initially thought (more on that in a moment), it’s likely the game would still become a bit of a drag without its writing and acting. It’s rare that a series has you caring so much about the fate of its characters, and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;’s story undoubtedly benefits from its real-life acting talent - even if their more detailed faces sometimes look a little odd next to the original models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drama is juxtaposed with some laugh out loud moments, particularly when it comes to the side missions, which in &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; tradition cover a much more diverse range of subjects, from virtual assistants to time travel. A particular highlight for me was a story where some loser took Kiryu to an internet cafe and introduced him to “live chat” (cam girls) - his complete lack of basic computing knowledge and overblown, one-key-at-a-time typing animations were hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-the-dragon&quot;&gt;Enter the dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the main mechanic of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; is the fighting, and boy will Kiryu find any excuse. Guy doesn’t like the look of me at an izakaya? Fight. Guy takes offence when I tell him to stop pissing in the street? Fight. Friend tries to stop me from kidnapping a baby? Also a fight. It’s all quite campy, usually involving people getting aggressive at the end of a cutscene and adopting fighting stances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the game goes on, more of the encounters are boss fights - usually signified by both participants ripping their shirts off before they duel. These are a bit more dramatic, set in arenas with plenty of implausably large objects to pick up and hit each other with. When your opponent is worn down enough, they’ll enter a heat mode, surrounded by red mist and noticeably more aggressive. In general, the boss fights are memorable and quite varied in terms of the tactics required to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yakuza-6_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the bosses, the game begins to pit you against more enemy types - big brutes with long health bars, agile ninjas, and so on. But from a certain point it just ups the numbers. While it’s cool to fight 15 guys at once and come out on top, it means half the battle is skirting the edges of the mob and picking off a straggler where you can, because entering the main fray means a frustrating and suicidal cycle of getting knocked down and hit again as you try to get up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a turning point. Upgrade your stats and skills enough and the game becomes far more satisfying. Your punches connect with multiple enemies at once in crowds, your blocks are more effective, and heat mode enables moves that - after some quick time event-style button hits - can knock away half the health of the toughest enemies if successful. Overall, once you’ve earned it, combat is far more complex and rewarding than I gave it credit for in the early game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-much-fun-to-care&quot;&gt;Too much fun to care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the rough edges - and the PS4 did struggle with some of the busier parts of Kamurocho before &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/02/playstation-5-first-impressions&quot;&gt;I upgraded to a PS5&lt;/a&gt; - I found &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/em&gt; to be a delightful return to the games of yesteryear. There’s a world with plenty of content to explore but without any collectathon objectives, an engaging story with varied and likeable characters, and mechanics that require thought and practice to master. And all of this comes on a disc as a single, complete package that’s playable forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in tone and fidelity (some cutscenes are noticeably more detailed than others, where characters look like mannequins with flapping jaws) are what made a certain era of video games, from roughly the start of the PS1’s lifespan to the the beginning of the Xbox 360 generation, so enjoyable. When the game’s fidelity is lower, our minds fill in the blanks, which makes titles more engrossing and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt; is by no means perfect - it can be frustrating, feels a little long, and parts of the plot require some leaps in logic - but it’s probably the best and most gripping game I’ve played so far this year. Come to explore Tokyo and Hiroshima and you’ll undoubtedly stay for the story, characters, and the outlandish sideshows.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="yakuza" /><category term="retro" /><summary type="html">It’s been a while since I published one of my longer gaming articles, but after playing Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, I felt compelled to put pen to digital paper.

After a short time with the console, here are my thoughts on Sony’s next-gen offering and how it measures up so far with the immensely successful PlayStation 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, it’s worth noting that the PS5 is still &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt;. The disc edition launched in 2020 at £450 in the UK, and almost three years on there have been no discounts - in fact, the same console will now cost you £480, after Sony upped the price. Still, I had reason to treat myself, so I decided to see this as an investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unboxing-and-setup&quot;&gt;Unboxing and setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the outer sleeve is a white, PlayStation-branded box, inside of which a cardboard tray holds the accessories (controller, power cable, HDMI cable, USB cable, and stand). I was surprised to find the PS5 itself simply suspended between two brackets underneath, but I suppose Sony must have done the calculations on the likelihood of damage and decided this was safe enough for transportation.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the earliest teasers, the initial impression when unboxing the console is that it is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; - bigger along every dimension than my launch PS4, to a degree where I still wonder whether my TV unit is giving the PS5 enough space and ventilation. I don’t mind the actual design as much as some others seem do, but it remains to be seen how easy it will be to keep all the pointy-out bits at the top clean of dust and dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you have good, strong nails, because one of the first things you’ll be doing is picking a cap out of the bottom of the PS5 to be able to screw in the stand. There is a nice little storage slot on the bottom of the base for what you removed, and the PS5 feels relatively sturdy once everything is in place. Aside from that, all you need to do is hook up all the cables in the relevant places and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you turn the PS5 on for the first time, there’s a slick installation wizard that guides you through PlayStation Network sign-in, privacy and power settings, and so on. You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to transfer the data from your PS4 automatically via WiFi, but this failed for me for an uknown reason (apparently “some data could not be copied” - why? And what about the rest?). By this point I’d installed some games and apps myself, so I gave up and made do with just my profile and save data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gui-and-experience&quot;&gt;GUI and experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migration issues aside, from the moment you land on the PS5’s main dashboard you can feel that it’s far more responsive than its predecessor. As Sony loaded more and more into the PS4’s interface it wasn’t uncommon to have to wait a few seconds for screens to load in. There’s none of that here, and everything is nice and snappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing games works much as it did before - and that goes for both PS5 games and PS4 games, which sit seamlessly alongside their next-gen counterparts. The only issue I ran into here is that it seems that if you own a PS4 disc but have bought a digital PS5 upgrade for the game, the PS4 version associated with the disc sometimes takes precedence in the ordering - hardly the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little tinkering, taking screenshots (vital for those who, say, run little-read gaming blogs) can also be sped up significantly compared to the PS4. The panel opened by pressing the Create button no longer pauses the game, which is a bit inconvenient, but it can be adjused so that a tap automatically creates a screenshot - much easier than having to open the sidebar and press the Square button ever was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaming&quot;&gt;Gaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the PS5 (mostly) set up, and having given myself a brief self-guided tour of the dashboard, it was time to dive into the next-generation gaming I’d heard so much about. Without any PS5 games to hand, my first stop was the PlayStation Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fifa-23&quot;&gt;FIFA 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On sale for £17, a digital copy of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/fifa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIFA 23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seemed like a good option to tide me over. The gameplay is as smooth as it has ever been, and stadiums and crowds have noticeably more detail. However, it’s hard to feel that you’re playing a truly next-gen game when there are so many similarities to every &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; since about 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To its credit, it does play a slower, more considered game of football than its predecessor, with each pass requiring more thought than before. I did encounter a few too many instances where the AI passed to a teammate in my penalty area and I didn’t even have a chance to place my defender for a tackle or block before they’d scored, which felt somewhat frustrating, but maybe it’s an adjustment thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two noteworthy sound features in &lt;em&gt;FIFA 23&lt;/em&gt;. The first is that certain sounds - the referee’s whistle, the ball hitting the net, and so on - come from your controller, which was so annoying that I turned it off after playing one match. The second is that the soundtrack consists of various songs from &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; games dating back to the 90s, which is a nice touch to mark the final entry bearing the famous name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gran-turismo-7&quot;&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/25/gran-turismo-7-ps4-review&quot;&gt;my review of the PS4 version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/gran-turismo&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic racing game on the track, hindered by a grating microtransaction funnel of an economy off it. That was one of several reasons I was hesitant to pay £10 to upgrade the game to its PS5 version, but I decided to give it a go, and in the end I was glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; just the next-gen version of the same game I was playing on PS4, it felt much more like a new game than &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; did. As expected, there is slightly more detail in the graphics - the areas around the circuits are denser, and the cars seem shinier than they did last generation. But that’s not the true value of the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much bigger and unexpected benefit was that the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of the game completely changed. &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; uses the PS5’s adaptive triggers to great effect, increasing resistance to braking at high speeds, for example, or relaying your lack of grip due to tyre wear. I’m not sure &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the game translates road feel to vibration and trigger tension (I’m sure there must be all sorts of complicated mathematics behind it), I just know it’s the best I’ve ever seen outside of a full sim racing setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yakuza-6-the-song-of-life&quot;&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My in-progress PS4 game at the time of my generational leap (and something you’ll be able to read about in a month or two) was &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;. In Tokyo and Hiroshima’s more populated areas, it sometimes felt like it was pushing the base PS4 to its limits, with an occasionally stuttering frame rate and some jagged edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a formal upgrade, the difference on PS5 is noticeable. The game runs more smoothly, graphical artefacts seem to be reduced, and loading times have certainly improved. It’s a promising sign for future enjoyment of my PS4 back catalogue on the new console as I wait for more PS5 games to trickle in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s getting harder as the decades to go on to justify the value of a console straight out of the blocks. I remember that I was immediately blown away the first time I plugged in a PlayStation 2 or Xbox 360, but ever since we entered the HD era the improvements from one generation to the next are incremental more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can say after a few days with the PlayStation 5 is that it’s a lot more responsive than my PS4, which would sometimes feel as though it was creaking along even when just using the menus or certain streaming apps, although I suppose that’s to be expected given the power differential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming-wise, it will take some time to see how developers use the upgraded hardware. &lt;em&gt;FIFA 23&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; - the latter especially - both do things that their PS4 versions don’t, but they’re hardly innovations with a massive impact on gameplay - they’re more add-ons and flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll see how I feel a few years down the line, but for now I’m happy with my purchase. This generation still has a lot in store, the PS5 is a significant upgrade from the PS4, and I know I’ll play enough games to justify the price tag - even at £480. Whether I’d feel as pleased as an upgrading PS4 Pro user, I don’t know, but in my personal circumstances the PS5 feels like the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="playstation" /><category term="hardware" /><category term="gran-turismo" /><category term="fifa" /><summary type="html">I had reason to reward myself last week, and having been hovering in indecision for some time, I decided it was finally time to pull the trigger and buy a PlayStation 5. After a short time with the console, here are my thoughts on Sony’s next-gen offering and how it measures up so far with the immensely successful PlayStation 4. Before diving in, it’s worth noting that the PS5 is still expensive. The disc edition launched in 2020 at £450 in the UK, and almost three years on there have been no discounts - in fact, the same console will now cost you £480, after Sony upped the price. Still, I had reason to treat myself, so I decided to see this as an investment. Unboxing and setup Under the outer sleeve is a white, PlayStation-branded box, inside of which a cardboard tray holds the accessories (controller, power cable, HDMI cable, USB cable, and stand). I was surprised to find the PS5 itself simply suspended between two brackets underneath, but I suppose Sony must have done the calculations on the likelihood of damage and decided this was safe enough for transportation.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ps5_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are you saving too much money?</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog//2023/06/18/are-you-saving-too-much-money" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are you saving too much money?" /><published>2023-06-17T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-06-17T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog//2023/06/18/are-you-saving-too-much-money</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratpack.blog//2023/06/18/are-you-saving-too-much-money">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to money, I’m something like a squirrel. I receive it and I tuck it away for later use, ensuring a more pleasurable future. But I recently heard a convincing argument for spending more in the present to avoid missing out on experiences that may not be possible later on, and thought that was worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delaying-gratification-for-too-long&quot;&gt;Delaying gratification for too long&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/G454/traffic.megaphone.fm/SIXMSB5490111876.mp3?updated=1686753558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This weekend’s episode of Modern Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; featured trader and hedge fund manager Bill Perkins, who was on the podcast to discuss his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Die-Zero-Getting-Your-Money/dp/0358099765/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die With Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He essentially gave a warning against saving too much money for too long, instead advising listeners to use the resources of health, wealth, and time together to maximise the number of positive life experiences you get to enjoy before you die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His logic here was that by focusing on your bank balance and waiting for retirement to start spending and really enjoying life, you’ll miss out on irreplaceable experiences in the meantime. You’re unlikely to be able to do physically demanding things when you’re old, you can’t do hedonistic things when you’re married with kids, and your kids won’t want you to read bedtime stories to them when they’re teenagers, so you need to prioritise the right things at the right times in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue, Perkins said, is that many people have blockers to spending money. Either their egos are tied to their wealth, or the habit of saving becomes so ingrained that they lose the mental connection between hard work and subsequent enjoyment, and become drones working jobs they don’t enjoy on the promise of a future reward somewhere over the horizon that may never become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His advice was to instead treat life like a game of &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;, not only selecting the experiences you’d like to live out but also slotting them into the right places where you have the money, time, endurance, and flexibility to make the most of them. Memories pay dividends, he added - living is not just about the moment, but enjoyment in the years afterwards recalling experiences and telling stories.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-money-saving-instinct&quot;&gt;The money saving instinct&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my own life, I think there is a natural tendency to save every penny that some people have to overcome more than others. I was never poor growing up, but I did come from a working class town, and when I first moved to London I was just about scraping by, considering every purchase in detail and lucky if I had anything left to transfer to my savings account at the end of each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my first corporate job, I suddenly had disposable income, but my instinct was to save as much as I could rather than paying for any luxuries. What if I lost my job? Or I reached a point where my wage stagnated for years? While building some form of financial cushion was undoubtedly a good move, I took this to an extreme and missed out on a lot of experiences in my 20s as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, just as I reached a level of income where I felt comfortable to loosen the purse strings somewhat, the COVID pandemic hit and I was stuck at home in lockdown. I developed anxiety during the long isolation, so even when I started to emerge more in 2022, mundane things like train journeys were absolute ordeals and I really had to push myself to get back out there with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My struggles in the last few years have given me an increased appreciation of the variety of experiences life has to offer, and since then I’ve been doing my best to say yes to as much as possible. I’ve visited Greece and &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/14/lesson-curiosity-japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and accepted invitations I might have turned down to eat different foods and play new sports and games. This has meant exposing myself to potential public embarrassment - something my anxiety never would have allowed at last year’s levels - but helps me to grow more resilient and generates new memories with my friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-golden-mean&quot;&gt;Finding the golden mean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this relates to one of Aristotle’s ideas, which he explained in &lt;em&gt;The Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt;. He argued that all possible traits exist along a spectrum, with deficiency and excess at either end and an ideal golden mean in the middle - essentially a more complex version of the saying, “All things in moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving all excess income leads to missed opportunities and experiences, and spending everything you earn on experiences means a less stable future. With that in mind, I intend to hover near the golden mean, maintaining a baseline level of savings, but continuing to embrace chances to try new things as they arrive. As Perkins said, if I don’t live life now, then I may never have a second shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you haven’t already done so, I’d very much recommend listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/G454/traffic.megaphone.fm/SIXMSB5490111876.mp3?updated=1686753558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the full episode of Modern Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; featuring Bill Perkins, in which he explains his philosophy on life and approach to balancing health, wealth, and time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="money" /><category term="philosophy" /><summary type="html">When it comes to money, I’m something like a squirrel.

That doesn’t mean that I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; Bethesda’s most recent “proper” game - I completed two lengthy playthroughs, one on release and one during the COVID pandemic - but for whatever reason it just didn’t grab me in the same way that old RPGs like &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/elder-scrolls&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;watered-down-wasteland&quot;&gt;Watered-down wasteland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, as I read more analysis, I began to understand why that was. While &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/elder-scrolls&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/fallout&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and other games had left me to forge my own way through their worlds, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt; let me craft my character’s &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt;, but didn’t offer half of their flexibility when it came to their &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/starfield_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; also suffered from this issue to a degree, of course, casting the player as the “chosen one” Dragonborn, but it was much easier to ignore. &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt; not only had a character-defining main quest, but featured worse side quest writing, and mismatched dialogue menu options and response tones, and in voicing the main character presented them as a much more developed individual in-game, leaving little to the player’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the main quest stole a lot of the focus away from the world. Not only did it seem there were fewer side quests, but they were less remarkable in their content than those in previous games, and there was less potential for interesting stories since most quests focused on gunplay, rather than talking your way out of trouble. It was enough to make you yearn for the richness of the Mojave Wasteland (sans nuclear winter).&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-pale-imitation&quot;&gt;A pale imitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when Obsidian, the developer behind &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/fallout&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it was working on a new &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/rpg&quot;&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, my excitement hit fever pitch. Their prior work included once of the most roleplay-friendly games and immersive worlds of all time, so surely a game of their own would restore all the features we loved and blow the watered-down &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; out of the water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was… not really. &lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; was a game of above-average quality, but it never really captured my attention and I didn’t get anywhere close to completing the story. The structure - a series of hubs on different planets - obstructed any chance of recapturing the “man against the world”, choose-your-own-adventure feel of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue for me, however, was the tone. &lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; felt like it was written by a sixth-form politics student, a game-shaped manifestation of the Twitter accounts that repeatedly yell “Isn’t capitalism bad?” without acknowledging any of its benefits or offering a viable alternative. This also meant that most quest decision points offered only saintly good or comically bad options, with no moral grey area or tough dilemmas to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining third of &lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt;’ personality was… quirkiness, to a degree never seen before in Bethesda games, despite their occasional oddball moments. Somehow Obsidian managed to crank this up to eleven while also sanitising it was far as possible, culminating in a bland, jokey atmosphere reminiscent of the modern Marvel movie formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-ray-of-hope&quot;&gt;A ray of hope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;. I know it’s a marketing cliche at this point, but watching the preview at the weekend I really felt that thrill of old Bethesda games again, like I could really go anywhere and do anything in this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonally, the new game looks to be just what you’d expect from the makers of &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;. That is, it’s primarily set in a serious world with serious characters, with just the occasional quirky beat on the side - the return of the Adoring Fan as an optional trait-based follower, for example. This helps massively with immersion, as unless I choose to see humorous content it looks like I can count on &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; to play it straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size and freedom is always an issue with space games, as the nature of space exploration means areas must be broken up between planets. How can you provide enough planets to simulate a region of space without them being procedurally generated and empty? The jury will be out in September, but somehow Bethesda appears to found a happy middle ground between the sparse vastness of &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; and the tightly-packed &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will the gunplay be like? Will planets feel repetitive? What exactly will the ratio of hand-built content to algorithmically generated areas be? How cumbersome will travel between planets feel? There are a lot of open questions ahead of &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;’s launch, but I’m hoping Bethesda has combined its experience with fan feedback on recent games and produced that rare special RPG - after all, with the increasingly casual changes introduced in &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;, it may be the last chance many players give it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-is-bright-hopefully&quot;&gt;The future is bright (hopefully)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Todd Howard so enthusiastically reminded us during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOPoAq5vIA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; deep dive&lt;/a&gt;, this is the first new world Bethesda has created in decades, and a new subgenre for the studio, so even beyond the usual launch bugs that come with a game so complex, there’s a lot that could go wrong. But from what we’ve seen, it feels like some lessons have been learnt and the balance is there, so I’m cautiously optimistic ahead of 6th September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, this is the most enthusiastic I’ve been about gaming for years. Between &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 3&lt;/em&gt; remake, and some of the smaller games shown off over trailer season, it feels like there’s a healthier vein of larger studios and publishers shrugging off &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/14/why-is-everything-a-live-service&quot;&gt;the live service-obsessed, microtransaction-filled, multiplayer-first trend&lt;/a&gt; of recent years and investing in the high-quality single-player games we’ve all been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="starfield" /><category term="rpg" /><category term="the-outer-worlds" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="elder-scrolls" /><summary type="html">There was a time in about 2018 when I thought The Outer Worlds would be the fix for Fallout 4.

A little nostalgia is healthy, but occasionally I bring myself down with the thought that I could have lived in a generally more friendly and pleasant era than the one I inhabit, which isn’t productive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-things-really-getting-worse&quot;&gt;Are things really getting worse?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine my intrigue then, when I stumbled across an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the illusion of moral decline&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Mastroianni this week. In it, he provides the figures that show that people believe morality is in decline, people have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; believed that morality is in decline, and that by objective measures morality hasn’t actually declined at all - if anything, it may have improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: If things are getting better, why do we always think they’re getting worse? Mastroianni’s article offers several possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People just say that morality is in decline when asked because they think it makes them look more moral personally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are nicer to you when you’re a kid and therefore seem to get meaner when you grow up and they treat you like an adult&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People hear cherry-picked stories about how lovely the past was from relatives, television series, and films&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People think younger generations are less moral than they were because they are biased to forget immoral things they did when young&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theory put forward in the article is that people pay more attention to negative information, but memories of positive things last longer. Therefore the present seems worse than it is, and the past seems better than it was, misleading us to believe morality is in decline.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-factors&quot;&gt;Additional factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Mastrianni’s points (as I should - he’s a proper social psychologist with statistics to back him up and everything), but his article also got me thinking about additional elements that might be contributing. While natural biases certainly play a big part, I also think there are environmental factors in the modern world that amplify the effect of our tendency to believe the present is worse than it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;were-shown-more-immorality&quot;&gt;We’re shown more immorality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From real-life horrors to disturbing fiction, it’s a lot easier to come into contact with immoral content in 2023. It’s not unusual to encounter terrifying or gory images on social media, the 24/7 news cycle is always hungry for new negative stories, and there are any number serial killer documentaries available on demand on your favourite streaming site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of the arts, we now casually watch series that would never get made decades ago. I can turn on &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; and see people doing horrific things (no spoilers), &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; was about a brutal drug lord, and Netflix even made a series about Jeffrey Dahmer. I’ve been reading St Augustine’s &lt;em&gt;Confessions&lt;/em&gt;, and even back in the fourth century he was writing about how he felt he absorbed negativity from drama into his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even taking a step back down the morality scale, it’s easy to see how the internet could turn us all into pessimists. At one time porn would have meant a dirty video or magazine your friend found - now it’s thousands of women flaunting themselves on social media to advertise their OnlyFans accounts. And how many arguments would you see or get into in the 1990s? In 2023, I can open my phone at any time and read a Twitter dispute that the participants would like never have in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;we-believe-more-things-are-immoral&quot;&gt;We believe more things are immoral&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive in, there’s a point to be made around the word “immoral”. Somebody answering a survey might not necessarily have to believe that people have become more sinful or evil to respond that morality is in decline. They could also have fewer positive experiences with others, or see others express more views that they personally disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, increasing polarisation in politics (and other arenas) is a likely contributor to the impression of immorality - and this looks to be supported by a spike after 2016 in some of Mastrianni’s graphs. Speaking in US terms, Democrats and Republicans used to be respectful rivals - now they both see each other as a “threat to democracy” and their country itself, to a level where it’s almost become a meme for social media users not to be able to endure a Thanksgiving dinner with relatives from the opposing camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has always been split almost 50/50 politically, so even if you believe one party to be immoral, the level of immorality hasn’t really changed - it just seems the rhetoric has reached a level where people are much more sensitive to others who have views incompatible with theirs, and therefore might be more likely to &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; (and report) them as immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-immoral-people-are-getting-caught&quot;&gt;More immoral people are getting caught&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, it was easier to be invisibly immoral. Without CCTV and DNA analysis, it is likely that a greater number of criminals went undetected. Without the internet, the widest reach anybody’s unsavoury views could muster depended on how loudly they could yell in the town square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty standard example of the need to consider the causes &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; statistics. If more murderers are going to jail, that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; mean there are more murders, but it could also mean there is more justice being dealt. If more people seem to be saying objectionable things, that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; mean there are more people with these beliefs, or it could just mean they have an easier way to reach more people - and get called out - than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; more people get caught. Once upon a time, a local murderer’s arrest would be reported in the newspaper, and if you missed that day’s issue or television bulletin then you’d likely miss the story. Now these news stories are run 24/7 on television, go viral on social media, are pushed to our phones as notifications, and are available forever online - so it’s easy to feel like there are more of these stories around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve made it this far without doing so, I’d really recommend you take the time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read the original article&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far better researched and more scientifically backed than my two cents are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="philosophy" /><category term="psychology" /><summary type="html">It’s a little embarrassing to admit it publicly, but I sometimes suffer from the “le wrong generation” syndrome that seems to plague online comments sections. A little nostalgia is healthy, but occasionally I bring myself down with the thought that I could have lived in a generally more friendly and pleasant era than the one I inhabit, which isn’t productive at all. Are things really getting worse? Imagine my intrigue then, when I stumbled across an article on the illusion of moral decline by Adam Mastroianni this week. In it, he provides the figures that show that people believe morality is in decline, people have always believed that morality is in decline, and that by objective measures morality hasn’t actually declined at all - if anything, it may have improved. This begs the question: If things are getting better, why do we always think they’re getting worse? Mastroianni’s article offers several possible reasons: People just say that morality is in decline when asked because they think it makes them look more moral personally People are nicer to you when you’re a kid and therefore seem to get meaner when you grow up and they treat you like an adult People hear cherry-picked stories about how lovely the past was from relatives, television series, and films People think younger generations are less moral than they were because they are biased to forget immoral things they did when young The main theory put forward in the article is that people pay more attention to negative information, but memories of positive things last longer. Therefore the present seems worse than it is, and the past seems better than it was, misleading us to believe morality is in decline.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A lesson in curiosity from Japan</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog//2023/05/14/lesson-curiosity-japan" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A lesson in curiosity from Japan" /><published>2023-05-14T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-14T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog//2023/05/14/lesson-curiosity-japan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratpack.blog//2023/05/14/lesson-curiosity-japan">&lt;p&gt;I recently returned from a couple of weeks out in Japan, and while I saw and experienced some amazing places, sights, and foods, I think the thing that will stay with me from this trip is more of an attitude I hope I will be able to retain long after the end of my holiday and absorb into my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/japan.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that always strikes me when I visit Japan is the level of curiosity on display for niche subjects. One example of this can be seen on TV every day - each area of the country has its own specialties, and on any channel you can find presenters visiting little local restaurants, cafes, shops, and so on to try them and speak to their creators about how they are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positivity-personified&quot;&gt;Positivity personified&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my most recent visit, I was lucky enough to see this outlook personified. In the buildup to my trip, I’d asked if a friend of a friend could help me get tickets to an event. As it turned out, he didn’t just buy a ticket, but also came with me and invited me to hang out with this friends the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t communicate fluently (my Japanese and his English are both very basic) but we had a great time together. I think more than anything he was delighted that I’d taken an interest in one of his passions, and as we departed he gave me a very sentimental goodbye gift with a handwritten thank you message, which was more touching than I’d been expecting.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially it made me smile, but over time I considered it more deeply, thinking about the place it had come from, and realised how jaded modern life has made me. Especially since the dawn of the internet, life has me on high alert, always wary of being taken advantage of, and always conscious that no matter what I do, there will always be somebody better out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when I was on the receiving end of such kindness in Japan, my main concern was worry about whether my reactions might seem rude or ungrateful. It’s like the anxiety instilled in me by all those online horror stories, arguments, and comparisons has adjusted my natural response to focus on damage control, rather than gratitude or pure enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-have-control&quot;&gt;You have control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, one of the podcast episodes waiting in my queue when I got home was the dating expert Matthew Hussey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR-plImpf_8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;speaking on Modern Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. In a discussion about dating trends, he shared a poignant message that can essentially be summed up as: “Your actions dictate your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a part with relevance spanning well beyond dating, Hussey discouraged listeners from focusing on macro-level issues. An obsession with politics and global trends will affect your outlook and hold you back, when in fact your personal outcomes might be entirely different. And even if things do turn out the way the statistics suggest, you have more control than you think, and adjusting your actions can help to bring about different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His advice was to approach life with curiosity, asking questions like “How can this work out?”, “How can I be impressed by this person?”, and “What can I learn here?” Having read many books to overcome (or at least heavily reduce) anxiety in the last year, it immediately struck me that these questions all seek the positive, rather than fearing negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there’s some confirmation bias at play here, but to me, this seems to match what I learnt from my new friend. His gift now sits on a shelf in my flat, and I hope that long after the aura of my holiday as faded away it will still serve as a reminder in my daily life to stay grateful and curious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="japan" /><category term="philosophy" /><summary type="html">I recently returned from a couple of weeks out in Japan, and while I saw and experienced some amazing places, sights, and foods, I think the thing that will stay with me from this trip is more of an attitude I hope I will be able to retain long after the end of my holiday and absorb into my own life.

It was only via a coincidental search that I caught the titular single and Middle of a Breakup on Panic! at the Disco’s YouTube channel, and there seemed to be very little fanfare in the buildup to the album’s August 2022 release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viva-las-vengeance_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did realise the record was out, I listened through it exactly once on Spotify, my expectations fairly low given the more pop-focused direction of its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Pray for the Wicked&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe I was in the wrong mood or too distracted, but I didn’t think much of it, and skipped on tickets for the tour when I saw Brandon Urie was playing the album in full at gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How foolish I was. In mid-April 2023, I spotted an article from earlier in the year that said that Panic! at the Disco were no more, with Urie having wound down the project to focus on his family. In a mournful mood (&lt;em&gt;Pretty. Odd.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Death of a Bachelor&lt;/em&gt; are two of my favourite albums), I revisited &lt;em&gt;Viva Las Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; to see if anything clicked, or if I could piece together anything about his state of mind when writing and recording it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got beyond the two opening singles, I was entranced. Far from the last record’s bland pop, &lt;em&gt;Viva Las Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; is deliberately recorded as a tribute to 1970s rock, and in that sense almost serves as a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Pretty. Odd.&lt;/em&gt;’s 1960s tones. While there’s plenty of variety, these influences are most apparent in the Queen-style harmonies and Brian May-inspired solos.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, lyrics about sex and partners begin to look more like metaphors for Urie’s relationship with fame, the music industry, and Panic! itself. Look below the surface and there are allusions to his love-hate feelings for his station in life and ponderings about what might have been had he never been thrust into the limelight. If you think this sounds like self-pity, sometimes it is, but it never outstays its welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, &lt;em&gt;Viva Las Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; is a grower. What at first appears to be surface-level showmanship and derivative composition shows greater depth the more you listen. If this does turn out to be Panic! at the Disco’s last album - and it appears it will be, at least for the moment - then we should be thankful that the final release expanded their top two to a top three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;track-by-track&quot;&gt;Track by track&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Viva Las Vengeance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The opener sets the mood for the album, with a feeling that Urie is resigned to giving in to the pressures on him (“shut up and go to bed”). He’s not going out without a bang, though, as referenced by both the song’s final lyrics and the screaming falsetto with which they’re delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Middle of a Breakup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Energetic, catchy, and the pick of the album’s singles for me. My theory is that what initially felt like a typical Panic! sexual theme (“make-up sex in the middle of a breakup”) may actually be referring to the joy of performing shows for fans even while falling out of love with the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t Let the Light Go Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As slow and emotional as the album gets, with Urie expressing his gratitude for a partner that challenges him in all the right ways. Heartfelt, with a nice buildup, although the “heavy machinery” line is a little clunky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Local God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Probably the most interesting song on the album lyrically, as Urie appears to imagine what his life might have been like if he hadn’t become famous. A pleasant change of pace with some nice guitar work in the middle eight as he wholesomely muses on “teaching little kids how to rock and roll”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Star Spangled Banner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A stadium anthem with a chant-like chorus and jazzy, uptempo verses telling stories that seem to hark back to Urie’s teenage years. This nostalgic reflection on his and the band’s beginnings will be a recurring theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. God Killed Rock and Roll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If the album’s Queen influences weren’t obvious enough elsewhere, Panic! really hit the nail on the head here with some piano sections that sound like they’re ripped straight from Bohemian Rhapsody. Urie’s voice once again steals the show with the refrain, full of rock history references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Say It Louder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Feels like an interlude between two halves of the album, and serves as a flip side to Local God as Urie takes a moment to revel in Panic!’s success. In retrospect, the slow middle section about committing a rock show to memory reads like a mourning of the parts of the lifestyle he does enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Sugar Soaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lifts the mood as probably the most fun song on the record, even if it lacks the depth of many others. This upbeat, riff-based track has call-and-response verses before hitting a lively, catchy chorus that show off Urie’s vocal acumen with a clever chord switchout the second time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Something About Maggie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This track almost feels like a little tribute to &lt;em&gt;Pretty. Odd.&lt;/em&gt; in the middle of the album, complete with some familiar-sounding horns in the latter stages. Some lyrics in the verses could potentially be read as an acknowledgment of long-time fans’ criticisms of Panic!’s last, poppier album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Sad Clown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Almost certainly evidence that Urie knew he was quitting well before the public announcement. “Leave me alone,” he screams, amongst lyrics alluding to disillusionment with endless performances and online criticism. The verse melody and It’s My Life-style riff are personal highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. All By Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A slower number that I think deserved to be the final, farewell song. The lyrics speak to the universal experience of feeling down and locking yourself in your room to listen to a record, feeling that the artist is speaking directly to you and inspiring you to get back on your feet and achieve something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Do It to Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If I were to point to a weak point on the album, it’s probably this last song, which is just a little too repetitive for my tastes. The verses the most interesting segments, but make up on a small fraction of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

Not because it’s a bad film, but because as somebody who suffers from intermittent anxiety,  visiting a restaurant can sometimes be quite a tense experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-menu_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I like the food? If I don’t, should I eat it anyway? Will I seem uncultured if I don’t recognise the more exotic menu items? Are the waiting staff secretly judging me based on our brief interactions or overheard comments? &lt;em&gt;The Menu&lt;/em&gt; takes these anxieties, which I’m sure are common to some degree amongst much of the population, and cranks the dial up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dinner-is-served&quot;&gt;Dinner is served&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively mundane opening sees a group of customers pay $1,250 a head to visit an exclusive restaurant on an island, but even as they tuck in to their first courses, there are glances and comments that set off those internal alarm bells. It really makes for quite uncomfortable viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the guests are an obsessive foodie and his date, a restaurant critic, an actor, and a group of fintech bros. It feels like a very &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/13/glass-onion-review&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kind of group. For the first third of the film we watch them tour the island and eat, with a looming sense of dread (owed to an expertly creepy performance from Hong Chau as the maitre d’, Elsa) and some very sharp comedic writing.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, like &lt;em&gt;Triangle of Sadness&lt;/em&gt; (which at some point I’ll see if I remember enough of to write a review), &lt;em&gt;The Menu&lt;/em&gt; takes a lavish, exclusive experience that most people could only dream of enjoying and takes it completely off the rails. To its credit, &lt;em&gt;unlike&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Triangle of Sadness&lt;/em&gt;, the writing maintains its edge after this point and the second half is not entirely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threading-the-needle&quot;&gt;Threading the needle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailer made it look like the film would end in simple bloodshed, but although there is some action and slashing involved, I can assure you that it retains its expertise in making you shift awkwardly in your seat throughout. In fact, it takes a huge amount of skill to blend psychological horror and dining cringe to such a degree while maintaining a natural pacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particular credit goes to Ralph Fiennes, whose character Julian Slowik teeters on the border between gentleman and madman, having quite reasonable conversations with his guests one moment and asking the unthinkable of them the next. In many ways, he makes the film, balancing the needle at just the right point between comedy and thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing &lt;em&gt;The Menu&lt;/em&gt; has a knack for is giving you hope before snatching it away - with a dash of wit to stop the mood from feeling too sinister. Just when it appears to be heading for a ridiculous ending - and the eventual denouement is still its weakest element - it changes course yet again. A classic? Maybe not. But &lt;em&gt;The Menu&lt;/em&gt; is well worth two hours of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

Some changes in my personal life required my attention, but things are more settled now and updates should come more regularly - albeit with &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/08/what-to-expect-tsp-2023&quot;&gt;a slightly different flavour&lt;/a&gt; than before, and more variety in the subject matter I’ll be covering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest artefact to catch my attention is Patrick Barclay’s book &lt;em&gt;Mourinho: Further Anatomy of a Winner&lt;/em&gt;. As a Chelsea fan, Jose holds a special place in my heart despite his subsequent spells at Manchester United and Spurs, and his special relationship with his players and media mind games have always made him an interesting figure beyond mere club allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has only been updated as far as Chelsea’s 2015 Premier League title success, so there’s no coverage of Mourinho’s recent, more turbulent managerial stints, but it still provided some fascinating insights from the perspectives of both the press and the people who knew him best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;man-management&quot;&gt;Man management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment is a key part of football - especially for a manager at Chelsea or Real Madrid - but something that shone through clearly is Mourinho’s attention to individuals’ progression. Take this account from Joe Cole, who faced a tough start at Chelsea, but later showed dramatic improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“His criticism is always constructive - he’ll always sit me down and talk about my game and what he wants me to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mourinho was always on the lookout for those who wanted to learn, and was a firm believer that players are most likely to reach their potential when they are open to advice, rather than just relying on their natural ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-supportive-presence&quot;&gt;A supportive presence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mourinho was often described as a kind of “big brother” to his players, capable of being stern when needed, but often behaving as though he was one of them, trading jokes and joining in with their wild celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his impact went beyond the squad, and he had a reputation for being friendly with everybody he met, including stewards and ball boys - even when playing away at opponents’ stadiums. When he initially parted ways with Chelsea in 2007, many around the club were reportedly distraught.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, even the less savoury side of Mourinho’s character - the wild accusations made against opponents and officials, for example - appears to stem from a desire to take one for the team. These moments would usually occur after poor performances, and meant that the headlines would often be about his remarks rather than what happened on the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forward-as-one&quot;&gt;Forward as one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Mourinho always strove for an inclusive dressing room. He wanted all his players to love and trust each other, reportedly even going as far as to mandate that the entire squad should eat together at the same table to preserve unity and prevent the formation of cliques within the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mourinho always wanted to ensure that his team was performing as a collective - not relying on a few talented individuals - and the attention he paid to the entire squad meant that, somewhat unsually, even fringe players who struggled for first team minutes often spoke highly of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such was his focus on team spirit, in fact, that Mourinho reportedly didn’t even give the final team talk before most matches. Instead, he would give his directions earlier in the day, and a different player would be responsible for giving the last, rousing pre-game speech each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not to say that Mourinho himself couldn’t motivate his men. One figure interviewed (unfortunately I didn’t note who) said that a good coach “must make his men feel big, not small”, and that’s precisely what he did. Here’s John Terry, for example, on Chelsea’s culture during the seasons between 2004 and 2006 when they won back-to-back titles:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“When you’ve got a manager drumming it into you every day that you are the best… it rubs off on the players and we go out there believing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelsea didn’t come from nowhere when Roman Abramovich arrived, but those seasons were the start of a period of domestic dominance. Mourinho’s approach here reminds me of the old saying, “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have” - only here he was mentally dressing his players for success. And given his track record, you can only say that it worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="football" /><category term="business" /><category term="managment" /><category term="psychology" /><summary type="html">Apologies for the near two-month gap between articles.

The latest artefact to catch my attention is Patrick Barclay’s book Mourinho: Further Anatomy of a Winner. As a Chelsea fan, Jose holds a special place in my heart despite his subsequent spells at Manchester United and Spurs, and his special relationship with his players and media mind games have always made him an interesting figure beyond mere club allegiance. The book has only been updated as far as Chelsea’s 2015 Premier League title success, so there’s no coverage of Mourinho’s recent, more turbulent managerial stints, but it still provided some fascinating insights from the perspectives of both the press and the people who knew him best. Man management Recruitment is a key part of football - especially for a manager at Chelsea or Real Madrid - but something that shone through clearly is Mourinho’s attention to individuals’ progression. Take this account from Joe Cole, who faced a tough start at Chelsea, but later showed dramatic improvement: “His criticism is always constructive - he’ll always sit me down and talk about my game and what he wants me to do.” Mourinho was always on the lookout for those who wanted to learn, and was a firm believer that players are most likely to reach their potential when they are open to advice, rather than just relying on their natural ability. A supportive presence Mourinho was often described as a kind of “big brother” to his players, capable of being stern when needed, but often behaving as though he was one of them, trading jokes and joining in with their wild celebrations. But his impact went beyond the squad, and he had a reputation for being friendly with everybody he met, including stewards and ball boys - even when playing away at opponents’ stadiums. When he initially parted ways with Chelsea in 2007, many around the club were reportedly distraught.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
