At the time I had a general feeling that the game lacked the quirkiness of previous titles in the series, but couldn’t quite put my finger on what exactly was missing from the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an extra week to play the game and think more deeply about it, and I’ve been keeping a running list of all the things I noticed that were in previous versions of &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; but are not in &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve recreated this below, and will continue adding for as long as I keep playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/the-sims-4_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: There are likely to be some items on this list that either are in the game (and I just haven’t played long enough to see them) or were added in&lt;/em&gt; The Sims 4&lt;em&gt;’s many expansions. Let me know if so, but I’ll probably still keep them here - in the former scenario I’ve obviously seen a situation where they should have applied but didn’t, and in the latter it’s still not right that something that came with previous base games isn’t included now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burglars-burglaries-and-burglar-alarms&quot;&gt;Burglars, burglaries, and burglar alarms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with one that’s close to &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; fans’ hearts, every game prior to &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; had a burglar that would sometimes appear on your lot at night with a creepy little tune and try to steal your stuff. If you were prepared, you had an alarm and the police were immediately summoned. If you weren’t, your only hope was to try to wake your Sim and get them to call the police before the intruder could flee. Unfortunately this much-loved mechanic, which mixed things up from time to time, has completely disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variety-when-inviting-sims-over&quot;&gt;Variety when inviting Sims over&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; also seemingly strips back the possible responses when inviting Sims over to your house to hang out. The older games would keep track of their work schedules, give excuses (the frequency of which depended on your Sim’s relationship with them), and throw wildcards like asking if friends could come, too. Since getting started with &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, the only rejections I’ve had are if a Sim is sleeping (and they all wake at 7am, apparently) or if my Sim’s relationship is low enough that the two are mortal enemies.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sims-breaking-the-fourth-wall&quot;&gt;Sims breaking the fourth wall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Simlish’s most iconic moments were when Sims used to turn directly to the camera and yell, normally to complain about their needs. There were also times from &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt; onwards when Sims would quickly celebrate or complain about their next interactions depending on whether they matched their personalities or aspirations. As well as Sims being less vocal in general, these moments are gone in &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, which plays it much straighter - an odd choice for a game that is actually much &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sims-with-working-ears&quot;&gt;Sims with working ears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, if your Sim was sleeping in a room and somebody turned on a TV or stereo, they’d wake up and complain about the noise. In the series’ latest entry I can put my toddler to bed a tile away from a sound system blasting at full volume and they’ll sleep through it without any issues at all. Maybe this was deliberate - TVs and stereos are seemingly attractive objects to Sims left to their own devices - but it’s another example of a small omission that detracts from the game’s realism and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/the-sims-4_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reliable-sim-autonomy&quot;&gt;Reliable Sim autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Sims were roughly capable of taking care of themselves. They didn’t always get it perfectly right, but their AI was passable and they wouldn’t usually die if unattended. In fact, sometimes it was entertaining to hit the triple speed button and see what they got up to of their own accord. In &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; they all seem to have had lobotomies. Sometimes Sims will choose interactions that satisfy their needs, but if you give them an hour or two to themselves it’s much more common to see them stood on the spot, shrugging their shoulders and stretching until you intervene again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strange-non-player-characters&quot;&gt;Strange non-player characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the Social Bunny, the Sim Shrink, and Mrs. Crumplebottom? The Tragic Clown might have made an eventual comeback, but other than him, many of the fun and quirky side characters that used to show up in specific circumstances (usually emotionally extreme situations) or wander lots causing mischief have simply been cut out, which is a shame because they were key contributors to the slightly surreal atmosphere of the earlier games.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="the-sims" /><category term="life-sims" /><summary type="html">I wrote last week about my first impressions of The Sims 4 (spoiler alert: they weren’t great).

It was obvious that this was a way to get players hooked and sell more expansions, but I thought it was a good chance to try out the most recent game in one of the series I’ve spent the most hours with and write a review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-sims-4_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed from the title of this article, I didn’t get that far. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the story of how I got bored with &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; within a couple of hours - and what I did to keep myself entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-impressions&quot;&gt;First impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t dwell on it, but &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; is one of those games that sits in a special type of DRM hell, in that even if you buy it on Steam, your first ten minutes with EA’s latest life sim are likely to be spent dusting off the Origin client so you can actually play it. It’ll leave you longing for the days of &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt;, back when you could just buy a disc, install the game, and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I could finally start the game, what was evident is that EA were going for the largest market possible here. &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/01/asus-geforce-dual-gtx1060-o6g-review/&quot;&gt;My modest gaming rig&lt;/a&gt; plays most games from 2017 at their highest settings, but very few set themselves up that way after assessing my hardware. &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; automatically pushed all the sliders to the right - performance shouldn’t be an issue for many people here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-sims-4_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that everything is an upgrade or works perfectly. I noticed plenty of features that functioned well in previous &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; games, but are either absent or cause issues here. In Create-A-Sim, clothes can no longer be customised via a colour wheel, for example. More frustratingly, Sims frequently just ignore tasks assigned to them, which drop off their queues with no notification. This is especially frustrating when the task is critical, like giving a toddler some food before they are taken away. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the game just didn’t like the pathing in the house I built, but this is also the first time in however many hours of &lt;em&gt;Sims&lt;/em&gt; play that I’ve had to look up the cheat to reset a Sim who was seemingly just stuck. After a few more hours, NPCs I’d never met before also had a habit of strolling into my house, chatting with my toddlers or taking the rubbish out for my Sims. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-bored&quot;&gt;Getting bored&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accusation leveled at &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; by some older fans was that the focus of the game has shifted. It’s no longer about life simulation, they say, and more geared towards giving casual players the tools to build the house of their dreams and deck it out in fashionable items available via expansion and “stuff” packs. There’s an element of that here, but the thing that dented my enthusiasm for a playthrough was just an overwhelming feeling of monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s because I’m an older, more weary gamer now, but there really was a sense that I’d seen everything Live Mode had to offer before. &lt;em&gt;The Sims 3&lt;/em&gt; piled on the narrative with neighbourhood exploration and quests, but a lot of that seems to be gone (perhaps to be restored by expansions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-sims-4_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the way Sims interact with each other and the things around them, the main new feature is a series of mood states (e.g. happy, sad, flirty) that affect actions a Sim can take. While these do seem to affect Sims’ responses to others’ interactions, the new options available to the Sim experiencing the mood are mostly small variants on interactions we’ve seen a thousand times before: telling a self-deprecating joke if embarrassed, for example, or “attempting to flirt” if they’re down in the dumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I’m just not the target audience anymore, but this all felt very underwhelming. I was simply retreading ground I’d already covered as far back as &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt;, and there weren’t enough new quirks and surprises to keep me interested. &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; also seems incredibly easy. My Sim wanted a relationship, so I spoke to somebody on the street and went from casual conversation to flirting, kissing, agreeing to be partners, WooHooing, and trying for a baby all in one in-game evening. There was no challenge to it. So I made an executive decision: I abandoned the goal of writing a full review, and instead set out to test the game’s limits until they broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-the-game&quot;&gt;Breaking the game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After noticing how easy the game’s romance systems were, I set out on my own challenge - to see how many babies my Sim could father before things all came tumbling down around him. My Sim got into a routine, chatting to new people on the street, inviting them inside for a date, and trying for a baby the same day. It was ridiculous how easy this all was. He ended up with six simultaneous girlfriends, all of whom were potentially pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still seemed too easy, so I decided to add some peril by inviting all of them to a party at one of the girlfriends’ houses. I expected this to spark a wave of arguments and break-ups, but astoundingly they were all happy to chat and dance together as a group, somehow unaware of the ridiculous social dynamics at play. Nobody even batted an eyelid as Strat Packer disappeared upstairs to WooHoo with his first girlfriend, and he even used the opportunity to hit it off with her sister, adding a seventh potential heir to the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-sims-4_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm… How to up the stakes further? I invited all of the heavily pregnant Sims over to hang out and invited as many as possible to join the household (limited by the eight-Sim cap). Before too long, my Sim was living with three girlfriends and four children, with an additional four kids floating around the neighbourhood from the others. Also amusing was that only one of the other mothers decided to call my Sim to tell him about the birth of his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest move sparked the chaos I was looking for. Four children would have been challenging enough on their own, but it was the love square that really brought the spice. In attempting to take care of the kids, I couldn’t keep an eye on all my adult Sims at once, meaning that any automatic flirtation or kissing set in motion a log chain of fury, slaps, and mirror pep talks that finally gave the entertainment I was seeking. It turned out that balancing childcare and three relationships was the equivalent of a hard mode for &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, finally delivering the challenge I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Findings and conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from adding another crazy &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; story to the internet’s massive archive, what I learnt from all this is that &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; is just not very good as a vanilla life simulation game. It lacks the charm that the early entries in the series had, there aren’t enough new surprises to keep a long-time player entertained, and it’s even broken in some places where it wasn’t before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-sims-4_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the increased performance (specifically when handling ten or more Sims on the same lot at once) and inconsistent social system make it an entertaining playground for those who approach the game as a sandbox to complete unorthodox challenges or just to push the simulation to its limits. The potential for chaos here is huge, and if all you want to do is play God and watch things fall apart inside a virtual dollhouse, &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; is well worth the £4 or so it is frequently reduced to in Steam sales.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="the-sims" /><category term="life-sims" /><summary type="html">Having played a lot of The Sims as a child, I was interested to see The Sims 4 on offer for just a few pounds in the recent Steam sale.

But retro gaming on a PC has its downsides. You need to install an emulator for each console, clog up your hard drive with ROMs, and tweak settings to make sure the graphics look good on a modern monitor. Surely there must be an easier way to play old favourites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some friends recently gave me an amazing gift that provides the answer. The Raspberry Pi retro gaming kit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-retro-gaming-bundle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available from The Pi Hut&lt;/a&gt;, consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, the required memory card and cables, and two SNES-style controllers. It’s more than capable of running the free &lt;a href=&quot;https://retropie.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Retropie&lt;/a&gt; retro gaming distribution, which includes emulators for a large range of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/retropie_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll write a full explanation of how to set up and configure Retropie at a later date, but it’s all deliciously simple stuff: plug in the cables, install Linux and Retropie, copy some games over to the preconfigured network share, and get going. It’s also ridiculously easy to get a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One controller working either via USB or (with a little more tweaking) wireless, so I can’t speak to the quality of the USB controllers that came in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retropie can play games from a huge number of systems, including the PlayStation, PSP, Dreamcast, GameCube, Nintendo 64, several Game Boys, NES, SNES, and many more. Some of the more modern emulators don’t work due to the Raspberry Pi’s processor, unfortunately - but hey, you can’t have everything. I’ll just have to continue playing those games on my PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/retropie_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what the kit and Retropie give me is a neat little box that can sit under my TV and play a variety of digital retro games to break up my day. So far, that’s meant quite a bit of the 1995 game &lt;em&gt;Formula 1&lt;/em&gt; for the PS1, and - after quite a bit of fuss trying to get the Amiga emulator working - the absolute classic &lt;em&gt;Deluxe Galaga&lt;/em&gt;. It really all works rather well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll return to Retropie and how to set it up in future, including full details of the Amiga setup, but for now I just wanted to say how great this little kit is (and you could probably put it together even cheaper by buying the Pi outright).

One of the most recent additions to the pile was &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, a 2018 release from The Irregular Corporation that promises edutainment as you learn how to build a computer through the medium of video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pc-building-simulator_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what to expect, to be honest. How much of a game was there to be built out of the task of preparing a system to play games? &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/01/asus-geforce-dual-gtx1060-o6g-review/&quot;&gt;When I built my PC&lt;/a&gt; the reward was that I got to play said games, so barring some sort of gameception I couldn’t see how &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; could deliver. Despite these doubts, I dived into this recent Epic Games freebie anyway…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the setup: In &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; you take on the role of the new owner of a small IT shop, and spend your time servicing and building PCs for customers to make money and grow your business. The basic loop is that you’ll check your email for jobs, take delivery of the computer, diagnose the problem, order and install parts, sometimes install and run software or perform other maintenance tasks, and send it back to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your assignments become more complex as the game progresses, introducing new mechanics or getting more vague, with customers requesting “upgrades” or sending in broken systems without knowing what exactly the issue is. They also set budgets, so you need to meet their requirements without maxing out their PC build with the latest 3090 Ti. Some also hint at little details, noting that they like a particular parts manufacturer or cable colour, for example, and they’ll complain if you install used components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pc-building-simulator_6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your progression is limited by two factors. First, your access to parts in the game’s online store is dependent on your current level. As you level up, you’ll gain access to the flashier manufacturers and latest tech. Second, when customers receive their upgraded machines they’ll leave an online review, which influences a star rating that dictates which jobs you can pick up. This adds some variety to the jobs and components you’ll see as you play.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-toolset&quot;&gt;The toolset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game provides several different perspectives on all of this. At its most abstracted level, you play the technician in first person, walking around your office between different shelves, workbenches, and your desk. Emails and the online shop are accessed via your computer. At the end of the corridor is the exit door, clicking on which brings up the calendar and lets you progress to the next day. This adds a strategic element: Have you done everything you can today? Are any customers’ deadlines set to pass? And what delivery speed should you pay for from the parts shop in order to meet them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the meat of the game is in the PC building itself. After moving a system to your workbench you can start to take it apart and play with the pieces inside. You’ll be tasked with installing new parts, removing viruses (read: installing anti-virus from a USB stick and running a scan), cleaning filthy PCs with compressed air, using a tool called 3Dmark to benchmark gaming systems, and so on. Some customers, as the title of the game suggests, will even ask you to build a PC from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pc-building-simulator_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s computers are well rendered enough to satisfy tech geeks, with plenty of real-world parts depicted in decent detail. The controls are about as good as they could be: Click a part to remove, then click and hold to undo each screw holding it in. Probably the fussiest of the tasks is cleaning out a PC, which requires equipping the compressed air and holding down the mouse button to spray it around the case. The dust disappears in regions that share only a tenuous link to your movements - frustrating when you’re trying to clean up the one remaining component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that it’s not always clear exactly where a part should go - for example, there may be multiple drive bays and the game expects you to use one in particular. You must also prove every PC you work on can boot to the operating system, which requires individually plugging in the power cable, monitor, keyboard, and mouse (they won’t boot at all without any of these). This becomes monotonous after completing a couple of assignments, but you’ll be doing it for as long as you play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-difficulty&quot;&gt;The difficulty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the difficulty of the jobs ramps up as you progress, with more complex work requested or some diagnostic work needed. Things never get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; challenging, however - at least as far as I played - because everything always comes down to ordering a new part, removing some screws, and slotting the right pieces into place. Even when the problem isn’t known by the customer, it’s often explicitly stated elsewhere - for example, a “CPU not found” message in the BIOS when attempting to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, much of the difficulty in &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; lies in resource management. Your workshop only has room to store a few customers’ PCs, so getting them in and out as quickly as possible is crucial to maximising your income. And if you have multiple boxes waiting for new parts, it is more efficient to bundle those orders together and pay one delivery fee rather than buying them separately as you identify each requirementr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pc-building-simulator_5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, some tasks take a long time to complete and can be run simultaneously for efficiency. Specifically here I’m thinking of 3Dmark, which through some highly sophisticated testing I worked out takes about &lt;em&gt;90 seconds&lt;/em&gt; to run to completion. You can buy additional workbenches for your workshop once you reach the higher levels, meaning that if you time it right you can leave one PC running this test while you work on another. If you like min-maxing mechanics, you’ll enjoy these elements of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vibe&quot;&gt;The vibe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given some of the frustrations I noted earlier, you’re likely to want to dip in and out of the game in short bursts, and luckily the day progression system is - by design or by accident - quite well suited to this. While some strategy and simulation games fuel marathons that span into the early hours as you always feel you need to finish “just one more X”, I found it quite easy to boot the game up after work, fix a few PCs over a few days, and save and quit just after proceeding to the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; also has some jokey elements that provide the typical colour required to liven up these sorts of otherwise bland simulator games. There’s some genuinely enjoyable writing in customers’ emails, with some strongly characterised as stereotypical authors, film buffs, or gamers, with associated humour in their issues and responses. As with any IT job, you also sometimes find some amusing files on users’ desktops (although unfortunately you’re not able to open any of them to see what’s inside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pc-building-simulator_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also as good a place as any to note that the game has a sandbox mode, which can be a nice way to chill out when the grind and constant deadline pressure of the career mode gets too much. This has all the parts unlocked from the start (which admittedly is a bit of a nightmare when the component menus are sorted alphabetically with no filtering) and it was a nice distraction to try to build something as close to my real-life PC as possible, or put together a fantasy gaming rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-judgement&quot;&gt;The judgement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m split on whether &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; belongs in the “pointless simulator game” category or not. One one hand, the business building element is nice and makes me wish I could make a decent living by building systems with my hands and helping people like my in-game character. There’s a relaxing vibe to finishing a build, hearing the money clink in the till, and feeling like you’re progressing and building your little tech company up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, all of this comes at a cost, and that cost is feeling your heart sink every few seconds when you realise you have another boring task to complete (oh, I’ve got &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; set of screws to remove or cables to insert?). This feeling is exacerbated when you find yourself unable to return a PC to a customer because you forgot some minute, inconsequential part - normally a PCI lock or inner case element. This requires you to take the PC back to the workbench, remove the cover, install the part, screw the cover back on, and sometimes run the boot test again, and is perhaps the worst thing about the game - why not just let me return the PC and have the customer complain about a small part being missing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; will please the sort of tech nerd who salivates over the latest processors and graphics cards (or at least ones from 2018), but for me delivers none of the satisfaction of building a real PC because you’re always working between guardrails. When the main building mechanics could work as a touchscreen game, highlighting the next step without any thought on the player’s part, there’s no real challenge here beyond knowing roughly what each component in a PC does. I’m sure there are people out there who’ll love this, and I might revisit it for an hour or two from time to time, but the frustrations are too much to keep me hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most recent additions to the pile was PC Building Simulator, a 2018 release from The Irregular Corporation that promises edutainment as you learn how to build a computer through the medium of video games. I wasn’t sure what to expect, to be honest. How much of a game was there to be built out of the task of preparing a system to play games? When I built my PC the reward was that I got to play said games, so barring some sort of gameception I couldn’t see how PC Building Simulator could deliver.

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the events leading to MicroProse’s 1982 founding, &lt;em&gt;Memoir!&lt;/em&gt; covers the full span of Meier’s career, from the early days developing solo and using every trick in the book to pitch titles to games stores all the way to the internal politics that forced the founding of Firaxas and the gradual winning back of some of his most prized intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sid-meiers-memoir.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always wary of books by famous creators. More often than not they cover the who, where, and what of their careers - I worked at this company, I released this game, this person gave me some great advice - but not the how or the why. Maybe they think the bigger audience doesn’t have an interest in the intricacies of how great works are put together, and therefore decide to focus more on the glamour and big names in their industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sid Meier, on the other hand, gives a great deal more information about the games themselves. Each of &lt;em&gt;Memoir!&lt;/em&gt;’s chapters is dedicated to one or more titles in his extensive back catalogue, and the format varies for each. Expect insights into the inner workings of MicroProse and Firaxis, stories from Meier’s childhood and time staying with family in Switzerland, and stories about how other passions like music and golf influenced his titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the passages where Meier gets into game design itself are what set this book apart and will keep you turning the pages. When discussing his games, he zeroes in on the individual decisions that made or broke them. What shape should each space on the map be? How much of a story does a strategy game need? When should a free roaming game end? &lt;em&gt;Memoir!&lt;/em&gt; covers each of these questions and more. It rarely gets very technical, but as somebody who dabbled in bedroom game development in his youth, it really is fascinating to see how the pros approach conundrums like these.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meier also shares the rules that helped to make his games what they are - nobody should die in a Sid Meier game, for example, and the golden rule is that the player should always be given interesting decisions to make, with realism never coming at the expense of fun (something that I incidentally discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/16/pro-evolution-soccer-5-master-league&quot;&gt;my retrospective of &lt;em&gt;Pro Evolution Soccer 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last game covered by &lt;em&gt;Memoir!&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Sid Meier’s Starships&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in 2015. That final chapter is to me the most poignant of the whole book. In it, the author discusses the difference between Sid Meier and &lt;em&gt;Sid Meier!&lt;/em&gt;, and reflects on the way his career and the games industry have both developed since the 1980s. I won’t ruin the rest, but it was moving to read something so candid from such a legendary figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m probably the perfect target audience for this book - nerdy, with some amateur game development experience and a history of playing Sid Meier-created and -inspired games - but I don’t think I’m overselling it when I say this is the perfect video game autobiography. If you have even a passing interest in gaming (even outside of the strategy genre), game development, or Sid Meier himself, I’d certainly recommend picking up a copy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="books" /><category term="strategy" /><category term="civilization" /><summary type="html">A book I preordered six months ago finally landed on my doormat in October.

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that Silverstone is the pinnacle of UK motorsport venues, but Brands Hatch really stands out among the mid-tier circuits hosting events smaller than &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; Grands Prix. Its facilities are far better than I was expecting the first time I visited, but its beauty comes in its views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike circuits like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/08/29/btcc-formula-4-thruxton/&quot;&gt;Thruxton&lt;/a&gt;, which have only a few spectator areas, at Brands Hatch fans are allowed to walk the full perimeter of the track - and the differences in elevation between the various sections mean that often the majority of the course is visible from any individual spot you settle on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a complete view is what you’re after, the main grandstand on the main straight is the spot for you. Sitting atop Paddock Hill, these seats give great views down into Turn 1, with the more distant Druids hairpin to your left, Graham Hill bend straight ahead, and Clearways to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get closer to the action, Brands Hatch has you covered in that respect, too. Pictured is the view standing right next to the fence at the start line, but the other top spot for motorsport fans who like to smell the oil and hear the tyres squeal is Druids - cross the footbridge and you can stand right on the inside of the hairpin, metres away from the cars.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less-explored parts of the circuit also give great views. The photo below was taken from a little verge on the Southbank, where you can watch the drivers exit Druids and head down through Graham Hill bend - and even from there you can still keep an eye on what’s happening up at Paddock Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading back in the other direction, there are also good angles to be found around Surtees, Clearways, and Clark Curve, which are often the scene of intense on-track battles and spins (even more so on wet days like Saturday) as drivers test their cars’ limits around these long, fast corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s worth mentioning that Formula Ford uses Brands Hatch’s Indy configuration. Events with faster cars use the Grand Prix circuit, which doubles the length of the lap and opens up many more potential viewing spots, even if it removes the aforementioned complete visibility factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one downside, and the thing that will stop me visiting as often as I otherwise might, is that the circuit’s transport links are in decline. Buses between Swanley station and Brands Hatch have been cut back, leaving only a five-hour window between the first and last buses, and the last bus didn’t even turn up on Saturday, forcing me to take a taxi to get home. With fewer and less reliable buses, taxis are now the only option, really reducing Brands Hatch’s affordability as a day out for those of us without cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, when you can get there, it’s definitely worth it to spend a day wandering around the track and taking in the views from different corners. No other circuit I’ve been to has come close in terms of variety and just how picturesque the whole place is. So if you want to watch motorsport but don’t know where to start, give Brands Hatch a go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="motorsport" /><category term="formula-ford" /><summary type="html">I went to Brands Hatch this weekend to see some of the action at the 50th Formula Ford Festival.

Having used it extensively for everything from gaming, to work, to writing a novel, here are my thoughts on Razer’s mid-range model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aesthetics&quot;&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition out of its pristine packaging (seriously, they give Apple a run for their money in that department), the first thing you’ll notice is that it’s an extremely neat little package. The absence of the number pad reduces the length, and the minimalist metal board gives it both a nice weight and a straightforward look. The keyboard comes with a detachable USB-C cable, which is a little stiff and difficult to lay flat, but is as high-quality as everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEDs are nice and bright, as expected, and the function keys (the most useful of which are the audio controls) light up alone when the Fn key is held, which is a nice touch. The function icons themselves are printed onto the keys, rather than transparent sections that allow the light from the LEDs through, which is a slightly odd design choice and confused me once or twice early on. That might be due to the positioning of the lights, but it means you won’t be able to see which key does what in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months down the line and the only other comment to make here is about dust. All black devices collect dust, and the Huntsman Tournament Edition is no exception. The spaces between some of the keys are too small to brush dust off with your finger, so you’ll want a nice cloth to get in there properly. Also, the keys are too sensitive to clean the keyboard when the computer is on (more on that later). I clean it every couple of weeks and the dust doesn’t bother me in between, but this may not be the keyboard for you if you like everything to be pristine all the time.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you plug the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition into your computer for the first time, you’ll be prompted to install the Razer Synapse software. This is a requirement if you want to run some of the fancier LED setups, like reflecting the colours on the screen or running custom colours for individual keys. However, it has to run all the time and there are stories all over the internet of it using a strange amount of CPU compute time and RAM for such a simple utility. In short, it’s bloatware, and I quickly wanted rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the in-box documentation doesn’t tell you is that you can configure LED colours without running Razer Synapse. By pressing Fn, Ctrl, and the number keys, you can select from a range of modes (yes, that includes the rainbow scheme and the &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style keys that light up when you press them). Tapping the number key repeatedly will cycle through different key colours. Finally, press Fn and tap the menu key to cycle through colours for the function keys. It’s certainly more limited, but it’s enough for me and it’s certainly better than needing to run dedicated keyboard software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usability&quot;&gt;Usability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is very satisfying to type on, both to the touch and to the ear. The red Razer linear optical switches provide an almost instant response when you press a key, while still managing to deliver a satisfying (and loud) clack when the key reaches the bottom of its trajectory. You don’t need to be playing first-person shooters to feel the benefit, either - it’s just as nice to feel that extra bit of control when moving the camera around in &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/transport-fever&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Just don’t bring it to the office - your colleagues won’t be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With great responsiveness comes great sensitivity, and the negative segments of most reviews I read prior to buying the Huntsman Tournament Edition focused on the frustrations this can bring. Sure enough, in the first week or so using this keyboard I would occasionally mistype by lightly brushing keys by accident. But it didn’t take long to adapt and become more deliberate in my key presses, and now those mistakes are a lot rarer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At £130 (minus an extra discount if you sign up to the Razer newsletter), the Huntsman Tournament Edition is a great option for anyone looking for a first mechanical keyboard. As a complete package, it saves the confusion and expense of purchasing the board, switches, and keycaps separately, while still allowing for some customisation - different caps, switches, and cables can all be bought and fitted to apply your choice of colour scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LED setup has a worthy range of settings, even without installing the accompanying software, and - most importantly - the keyboard is a pleasure to type on. Complaints about sensitivity have been overstated elsewhere - you will get used to it - and it’s a small price to pay for a hyper-responsive keyboard with a neat little form factor and top-quality hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="hardware" /><summary type="html">It’s been a few months since I delved into the world of mechanical keyboards for the first time with the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition - a little black number with a hugely customisable LED setup and super-responsive keys. Having used it extensively for everything from gaming, to work, to writing a novel, here are my thoughts on Razer’s mid-range model. Aesthetics Once you’ve got the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition out of its pristine packaging (seriously, they give Apple a run for their money in that department), the first thing you’ll notice is that it’s an extremely neat little package. The absence of the number pad reduces the length, and the minimalist metal board gives it both a nice weight and a straightforward look. The keyboard comes with a detachable USB-C cable, which is a little stiff and difficult to lay flat, but is as high-quality as everything else. The LEDs are nice and bright, as expected, and the function keys (the most useful of which are the audio controls) light up alone when the Fn key is held, which is a nice touch. The function icons themselves are printed onto the keys, rather than transparent sections that allow the light from the LEDs through, which is a slightly odd design choice and confused me once or twice early on. That might be due to the positioning of the lights, but it means you won’t be able to see which key does what in a dark room. A few months down the line and the only other comment to make here is about dust. All black devices collect dust, and the Huntsman Tournament Edition is no exception. The spaces between some of the keys are too small to brush dust off with your finger, so you’ll want a nice cloth to get in there properly. Also, the keys are too sensitive to clean the keyboard when the computer is on (more on that later). I clean it every couple of weeks and the dust doesn’t bother me in between, but this may not be the keyboard for you if you like everything to be pristine all the time.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Gran Turismo 3 retrospective&amp;amp;colon; Progression and reward</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/gran-turismo-3-retrospective" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gran Turismo 3 retrospective&amp;colon; Progression and reward" /><published>2021-10-15T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-10-15T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/gran-turismo-3-retrospective</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/gran-turismo-3-retrospective">&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/gran-turismo&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon, I thought now seemed like a good time to revisit an earlier game in the series. The last entry I played at any length was &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt;, the then-next-gen PS2 title that hit the shelves in 2001, so I fired up the emulator and got racing. What was I looking for? Well, I’m sure later games had many improvements, but I wanted to revisit my own memories of the series and see whether the magic remained, or whether my enthusiasm for next year’s release is based on pure nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-the-racing&quot;&gt;Part I: The racing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the heart of the matter: the racing. The first thing you’ll notice is that &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; brushes up pretty well graphically. There’s not much going on outside the white lines and some circuits hide that better than others, but the tracks themselves have plenty of character and despite occasionally looking a bit flat (forgivable on the PS2) the cars - particularly the rear of your own car, which you’ll see plenty of - look great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game touts itself as a simulator, but takes a surprisingly arcadey approach. Although there is an option to qualify, the default route drops you straight into the race at the back of the grid and with no time to learn the track. Adding to this atmosphere is the soundtrack, which plays as you drive and includes some Feeder, an obscure early Muse track, and a couple of songs that sound like they were ripped from a &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fight scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls are simple: X to accelerate and square to brake. I found the steering a little twitchy, better managed with careful taps on the D-pad rather than the analogue stick. Cars have a habit of oversteering and requiring opposite lock for correction - momentum is the name of the game here, and you’ll want to avoid drifts and brushes with the barriers and the AI to maintain it. &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; is at its best when you hit a flow state and can throw the car around the corners while maintaining speed and stability.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worthy of a mention here is the force feedback, which does a fantastic job of communicating grip, movement, and textures like rumble strips. The subtlety of the system is amazing when compared even to later games. Reflections Interactive’s 2002 game &lt;em&gt;Stuntman&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has an almost binary vibration system which seemingly only activates under wheelspin. Compared to that, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; is like a symphony for your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI is typical of racing games at the time. If your car is powerful enough, you can take multiple places before the end of the first straight and move up to second, but the leading car is almost always perfectly tuned to give you a run for your money. It’s usually faster than you in a straight line, meaning the player has to take corners perfectly to bring home the win. This raises the stakes, and often the entire race is a tense battle for first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other drivers fight hard… Except they’re not really fighting - the AI is on rails, it hunts as a pack, and it will not think twice about ramming into you if you’re on its racing line. Given the immovable nature of vehicles in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt;, this can have a huge bearing on your race. If you’re in a mild spin, these shunts can either knock you back up to speed or leave you facing the wrong way, unable to salvage any positions. There are no in betweens, and when this gets in the way and effectively ends your race it’s infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-the-tracks&quot;&gt;Part II: The tracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracks in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; are mainly fictional. Laguna Seca and Côte d’Azur (Monaco) are the only real-world circuits and I think that is to the game’s benefit. The original tracks have a great flow with a lot of blind and flat-out corners, plus usually one or two tricky turns that deliver that little jolt of adrenaline when you finally take them just right. Whoever created these should be designing the modern &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; tracks! They certainly have a lot more challenge and character than Sochi or Yas Marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are three duds for me. At one end of the spectrum are the Test Track and Super Speedway, which are ovals that essentially require you to hold down the X button until your finger aches, although admittedly the latter does have more challenging turns. The other extreme is Special Stage Route 11, a track so complex (and where the AI is so overpowered) that just seeing the name on a cup schedule strikes fear into my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting design element to point out is that the fictional tracks do a great job of warning you about what’s ahead through in-game road signs. Although the tracks borrow some elements from real-life circuits, nobody knows Mid-Field Raceway or Grand Valley Speedway like they might know Silverstone or Suzuka when they play &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, so this is a useful addition when you’re thrown into a race at a new circuit. It’s a neat trick that retains more challenge and immersion than the now-common on-track racing line or arcade-style HUD icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-gran-turismo-mode&quot;&gt;Part III: Gran Turismo mode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The showpiece of the game, and where any sane person will spend most of their time, is Gran Turismo mode. The setup is simple: Armed with a mere 20,000 credits, you must buy a car, compete in races, and use the winnings to either upgrade your existing vehicle or buy a new one. Rinse and repeat until you own the car of your dreams and can compete in the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/16/pro-evolution-soccer-5-master-league&quot;&gt;the old &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; Master League&lt;/a&gt;, this makes for a classic gameplay loop. And also much like the old &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; Master League, you’ll have to battle with some confusingly poor menu translation along the way. That’s more than made up for, however, by the satisfaction of installing new parts that win you races and the jazzy music so typical of Japanese games of this era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those upgrades don’t just provide a speed improvement - the game does a really good job of conveying power through changes to engine sounds. And while in other racing games dominating the field can leave you wondering whether you should up the difficulty or rebalance the car, in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; it’s simply super gratifying to know you’re out in front because you’ve engineered that Mazda RX-7 to within an inch of its life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The byproduct of all this customisation is a steep difficulty curve. Your supercharged starter car will have plenty of power, but awful handling. At this point, every corner becomes a near-spin and you may find yourself having to grind out credits, too slow to win but too poor to buy a better car. But that’s the beauty of &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; - races and cups feel more like levels in other game genres than serious simulated competitions, and multiple attempts are required at each before you can take home the trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_8.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of challenges, some races require you to have earned particular racing licences in order to enter. Each licence consists of a series of tests, from driving in a straight line and stopping in a marked area to completing a fast lap of a circuit in the rain. I was expecting these to be more of a grind, but they’re actually a nice way to break things up and try some different cars early in the game. For the perfectionists, there are three pass grades, but scoring anything better than bronze takes some serious effort and I can imagine you’d go mad trying to 100 per cent all the licence tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running through an emulator, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt;’s graphics are more than passable, and the gameplay is a classic “easy to learn, impossible to master” affair. Add to that the variety of racing on offer (I haven’t even mentioned the endurance and rally events here), a set of refreshing original tracks, and a huge variety of parts to install and setup options to tweak, and you have plenty to keep you occupied as you work your way up the tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity and propensity to drift sometimes gets a little bit much, and the aforementioned shunts from the AI will leave you raging when they ruin your race on the last corner, but there’s always a feeling that you might have done a little bit better - avoided a spin, given opponents more space, or taken a better line. While the AI cars might have been given less weight, it’s forgivable because the capability just wasn’t there for anything much better 20 years ago. Most racing games of the time took a similar approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_11.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/16/pro-evolution-soccer-5-master-league&quot;&gt;my look back at &lt;em&gt;Pro Evolution Soccer 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that my favourite games take on some realistic features, but more importantly ensure they have a solid gameplay loop and are fun to play. &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; also falls into this category. Gran Turismo mode is an addictive cycle of racing, reward, and progression that drives you to replay the same cup races over and over until you succeed. It’s a formula like no other racing game - you won’t get the same thing in &lt;em&gt;F1 2021&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/project-cars&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Cars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; stands up surprisingly well two decades after its release. This is a package that has plenty to keep me playing &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/21/gran-turismo-7-campaign-mode/&quot;&gt;until &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; arrives&lt;/a&gt; - it’s simply addictive. And if I was ever to get bored with Polyphony Digital’s latest offering, it might just inspire me to explore the &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; games in between that I missed first time around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="racing" /><category term="gran-turismo" /><summary type="html">With Gran Turismo 7 on the horizon, I thought now seemed like a good time to revisit an earlier game in the series.

I’d wake up early in the week and head out for an hour or so, then go even further on weekends. Part of my reason for running was the therapeutic element - it was the only time I’d be alone with no screens, headphones, or other distractions. Another factor was that I was (and am) a data junkie, and tracking my pace and distance through an app and pushing myself to go further was a minor obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my peak I made it to half marathon distances, and my long weekend runs would be jaunts from my suburb into the middle of the city and back. I remember remarking to a friend at the time that running “felt like &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; for my feet”. He laughed it off, focusing on the absurdity of the statement rather than the logic behind it. As time went on, the cold months drew in, and I got busier with work, my running dropped off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years later, COVID-19 happened. I went from dragging a heavy bag around the city, jumping between offices and trains and bars, to sitting in my desk chair pretty much all day every day. To get at least some exercise, I returned to regular running over short distances, and when my enthusiasm began to wane in 2021, I signed up to provide some motivation. Back out on the pavements, it wasn’t long until the analogy came to mind once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/running_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people don’t appreciate the strategic element of Formula 1 (and therefore definitely wouldn’t like &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/motorsport-manager&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorsport Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Behind all the rivalries, battles, and crashes is a subtle game of chess. The name of this game is pace management - drivers and teams must carefully control how hard they’re pushing at any time to prolong the life of their tyres and ensure they have enough fuel to finish. Raw pace alone might grab pole position in qualifying, but it won’t win (or perhaps even finish) the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels with running are numerous. My legs take a while to warm up. I only have a finite amount of energy to expend. And if my route features an uphill section then I better not push too hard in the flat areas. When I leave my flat for any particular run I need to keep all this in mind, along with the length of the run itself. If I’m heading out for a midweek 5km run I know I can push hard throughout, but on a weekend 10km run I need to hold myself back and conserve energy to run further at a slower pace.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/running_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is twice as challenging at an organised event. Running in a pack, there’s an automatic tendency to push to keep up with others who are either faster or aren’t pacing themselves properly. If you don’t maintain your own pace and monitor your interval times, you’ll exhaust yourself before the end. Even if it feels like you’re losing out, the other runners are on different strategies. As an F1 engineer would say over the radio: “We’re not racing them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when it’s a just nice jog around the neighbourhood as the sun rises, your typical running app offers a wealth of stats for geeks like us. Comparing interval times from around your route, elevation, average pace, and so on is a fascinating bonus on top of the exercise itself and can provide great feedback to help on future runs. That said, don’t let it put you off - running can be as complex as you want to make it, but getting started is as easy as throwing on a pair of trainers and getting outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="running" /><category term="formula-1" /><summary type="html">A few years ago, I did a lot of running.

Gone was &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/pro-evolution-soccer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro Evolution Soccer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the stalwart of slower, more considered football gaming. In its place we were to be given a free-to-play, cross-platform title in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/efootball.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;eFootball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change, the skeptics warned, was a downgrade designed to unite PC, console, and mobile players and cash in on microtransactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to comment on eFootball 2022’s economics, but luckily its free-to-play format meant I could try out its gameplay without spending a penny. After a fair few games I can say that it’s not quite as bad as the graphical glitch memes would have you believe, but it’s much worse than last year’s &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; and, technically, a long way from being ready for the public to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few good ideas in there. The fluid ball collection system, where players will collect the ball to set up for set pieces without the usual fade to black, is a nice touch. But as with many &lt;em&gt;eFootball&lt;/em&gt; features, it’s prone to confusing failures. The most common for me was a player setting up for a corner while the camera stayed static, stuck looking at the penalty area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konami has also tried to apply some of &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s pre-match gloss with a new kit and lineup selection interface that does away with basic menus and builds these options into scenes of the teams arriving, warming up, and walking out of the tunnel. It’s a bit slow to have to do every time you play a match, but it does a good job of showing the atmosphere in the ground building up.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all know the most important part of any football game how it plays on the pitch, and it’s here that &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; lets us down irredeemably. The game is so rough around the edges that it’s essentially an alpha at this point, but even then there are many features mysteriously missing that probably wouldn’t require any effort for the developers to implement beyond adjusting a few variables. There are only two difficulty levels available, for example, and it’s impossible to play a match longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the supposed engine upgrade, the graphics are a definite step back from previous &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; titles. The stadiums actually look fine (although they have a startlingly loud new announcer who sounds like a random passer by at Konami HQ was asked to read bizarre lines like: “Smoking is only permitted in designated areas within these grounds” - what?!). But the pitch scenes, which you’ll be spending most of your time looking at, are so flat and lacking in detail that they are reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; games from ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other visual changes include a new default camera that zooms in on action on the near side of the pitch, seemingly to show off the dearth of detail. This makes it hard to pick out passes more than a couple of metres away, and after a game or two I quickly switched to the classic Wide view. There’s also an odd choice to show a circle on the ground under the active player - something that persists even in some cut scenes. This is a feature last seen on a console in &lt;em&gt;FIFA 2001&lt;/em&gt;, and is a jarring addition for a game that proclaims its realism and would probably like to avoid comparisons to mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing is key to football, and it’s horribly broken here. Opponents are absolute pros at interceptions - you won’t be threading any eye-of-the-needle balls through the defence because they desperately lunge at anything that moves, even in safe areas of the pitch. While that could be written off as an increase in difficulty, passing itself is horrifically slow. Recent &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; titles have always offered an alternative to &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s ping-pong exchanges, but even at maximum power it’s impossible to play a quick pass to a teammate. Only through balls seem to have any momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that even if you do play a perfect pass to a man in space, it’s likely that a defender has moved to cover him by the time the ball arrives. And even when the ball gets to the recipient, you’re not out of the woods yet. Players have an infuriating habit of forgetting the ball at key moments and simply running past it, leaving it for the defender to collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the passes, nothing to the game feels like it has any weight to it. Shooting in particular is deeply unsatisfying. Even a shot from the most stable of positions in acres of space feels like a snatched, scuffed attempt at goal taken on the turn. The knock-on effect is that goals feel more a result of coincidence than skill, depriving players of what is meant to be the high of the football game experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re perfectly happy to battle both the opponent and the controls, you’ll also have to fight the game engine itself. Despite downgrade the graphics have received, the game frequently stutters, especially during cut scenes, which run at a criminally low frame rate (and also, for some reason, you now have to press A or X twice to skip them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was to choose a word to describe &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; in its current state, it would be bland. Konami worked so hard over recent years to bring some fluidity and excitement back to &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt;, and it has all been undone in one new iteration. They have apologised and promised to take players’ feedback onboard in future patches, but it’s hard to see it would ever be possible match &lt;em&gt;PES 2021&lt;/em&gt; with such shaky foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planning to write a full review of &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; once the Master League DLC arrived, but if the gameplay hasn’t significantly improved by then (and that would take such an overhaul that I don’t see how it can without a U-turn to revert to the FOX Engine) then I won’t be spending a penny on this game, and in its current format you shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="pro-evolution-soccer" /><category term="efootball" /><category term="football" /><summary type="html">eFootball 2022 rang alarm bells as soon as it was announced. Gone was Pro Evolution Soccer, the stalwart of slower, more considered football gaming. In its place we were to be given a free-to-play, cross-platform title in the form of eFootball. The change, the skeptics warned, was a downgrade designed to unite PC, console, and mobile players and cash in on microtransactions. It’s too early to comment on eFootball 2022’s economics, but luckily its free-to-play format meant I could try out its gameplay without spending a penny. After a fair few games I can say that it’s not quite as bad as the graphical glitch memes would have you believe, but it’s much worse than last year’s PES and, technically, a long way from being ready for the public to play. There are a few good ideas in there. The fluid ball collection system, where players will collect the ball to set up for set pieces without the usual fade to black, is a nice touch. But as with many eFootball features, it’s prone to confusing failures. The most common for me was a player setting up for a corner while the camera stayed static, stuck looking at the penalty area.
