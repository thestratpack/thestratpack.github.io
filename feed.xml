Batman Begins focuses very much on Bruce Wayne and his motivations Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, starring Christian Bale, was probably the last superhero series I was excited about - perhaps because it didn’t feel very super at all. Batman is a feasible character, just a rich guy with a taste for justice and some cool gadgets, and that suited Nolan’s very grounded style perfectly. With that in mind, I put aside one of my few remaining free days to watch all three films, starting with Batman Begins, which set out to establish the Bruce Wayne character and lay the foundations for its bigger-budget sequels. Gotham’s symbol of justice The film begins in usual Batman style, with the murder of Bruce Wayne’s parents. He feels guilty because this occurred after he convinced them to leave the opera early because the show reminded him of his biggest fear: bats. This is the first of many examples of how tightly Nolan ties everything together in the film. Over time, Wayne’s guilt morphs to anger. He plans to kill his parents’ murderer when he is granted parole, but someone gets there first. On discovering his plan, his childhood friend Rachel says it wouldn’t have helped anyway - the mob boss Falcone is undoing all his father’s good work in the city (we see later that even the monorail he funded is now heavily vandalised and covered in graffiti). Bruce seeks out Falcone, but is threatened and warned that people like him “have too much to lose”. This theme is repeated throughout Wayne’s training with the League of Shadows - that he needs to become “more than a man” in the eyes of his enemies, “an idea”. It is from these beginnings and a desire to confront his childhood fear - the very one that indirectly led to his parents’ deaths - that he develops the concept of Gotham’s protector: the Batman. “As a man, I’m flesh and blood. I can be ignored. I can be destroyed. But as a symbol… I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting.” - Bruce Wayne A supervillain in an ordinary world After leaving the League because he refuses to kill a criminal, Wayne returns to Gotham. Unbeknown to him, Scarecrow (an early appearance for Cillian Murphy) is using his daytime role as a psychiatrist to move the city’s most dangerous criminals to Arkham Asylum and place them under his own watch. An extremely clever move here is that Scarecrow relies on hallucinogens to intimidate his victims. This has the triple effect of creating a genuinely scary villain in a grounded universe, helps to further establish Wayne’s character as he hallucinates about the bats he’s so scared of, and connects with Batman’s origins - it’s later revealed that the compound is based on the same toxic flower he delivered to the League of Shadows to be deemed worthy of his training. Scarecrow is ultimately revealed to have been manipulated by the League of Shadows, whose plan is to poison Gotham’s water supply, vaporise the water to drug its citizens, and sit back and watch as they tear the city apart. This enables a creepy finale when the Narrows is engulfed in mist, with crazies hiding around every corner and Scarecrow galloping around on horseback. It’s the clearest indicator yet of the dark tone the series will lean into as it progresses. Batman finds himself on the monorail his father built, hurtling with his mentor turned enemy Ra’s al Ghul towards Wayne Tower, where we’re told the chaos will spread to the whole city. A rare criticism from me is how heavy-handed the exposition is in this section, with a water technician stating the stakes in no uncertain terms despite the villains’ plan having been explained already. “The pressure’s moving along the mains, blowing all our pipes. And if that pressure reaches us, the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!” - water technician A kiss with a catch Batman’s one rule is tested, but he settles on a compromise as the two zip towards the end of a track damaged by Jim Gordon. “I won’t kill you, but I don’t have to save you,” he says, leaping from the carriage moments before it falls with the antagonist still inside - a statement that by itself could inspire an entire philosophical debate (and does, in the case of Good Samaritan laws). Having saved the day as Batman, Wayne regains control of his company. Wayne Manor is to be rebuilt after the League of Shadows burnt it down, Gordon has been promoted and is firmly on Batman’s side despite the police force’s official stance, and Gotham’s criminal element is spiralling. All the pieces are in place to support the Batman status quo and the escalations in the next two films. Wayne even gets a kiss from Rachel - but there’s a catch. She says he’s changed from their younger days, that his guilt and anger has taken hold to an extent where he’s more Batman than Bruce. Perhaps once Gotham is in a better place, he’ll finally be able to rest and she can be with him. But for now, the city needs him more than she does - to whet our appetites for the second instalment, Gordon’s men have recovered the Joker’s calling card from a crime scene. “This is your mask. Your real face is the one that criminals now fear. The man I loved - the man who vanished - he never came back at all… Maybe some day, when Gotham no longer needs Batman, I’ll see him again.” - Rachel Dawes Straight-faced saviour On its release in 2005, Batman Begins wasn’t really on my radar. I caught it on a coach trip once (although likely slept through large parts), but I really jumped into the series at The Dark Knight, and with my standards set by Heath Ledger’s Joker and the huge set pieces, its predecessor always felt duller by comparison. But I have to say, I now realise I did it a complete disservice. Batman Begins starts from scratch with a clear objective: to introduce characters and their motivations and set up the elements and themes that would run through the trilogy. But more than that, I felt it was more constrained and tighter than the later films - not a moment is wasted, with everything from the Wayne-built monorail, to the hallucinogenic flower, to the Batcave’s location all coming full circle. Nolan brings an artistry to the genre that’s rarely applied now superhero films have become commoditised. None of the bright colours, fantastical mumbo jumbo, or edgy quips present in modern Marvel can be found here. The plot is taken almost as seriously as Oppenheimer’s, even venturing into some light political threads, and that’s as refreshing now as it was in its own time. Bruce Wayne’s character is inspirational not only because he fights crime, but because he is a flawed individual whose deeper morality and mission grants him virtue even when his public image is damaged - sometimes deliberately, when his cause requires it. Batman Begins sets him up as Gotham’s would-be saviour, but this was only the start of a journey that would involve far greater sacrifice. 4/5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/batman-begins_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/batman-begins_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Death Stranding 2 at the Tokyo Game Show 2024</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/29/death-stranding-2-tgs-2024" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Death Stranding 2 at the Tokyo Game Show 2024" /><published>2024-09-29T01:00:01+01:00</published><updated>2024-09-29T01:00:01+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/29/death-stranding-2-tgs-2024</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="death-stranding" /><category term="playstation" /><summary type="html">🐈‍⬛ We’ve had another small glimpse of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.

Astro Bot was a surprise double-A hit, with a stripped-back scope and simple gameplay loop that made it feel like playing a retro game on PS5 steroids. Parking Garage Rally Circuit takes things a step further – it looks like a retro game, too! Speed and control While Walaber Entertainment’s official description says PGRC is meant to look like a Sega Saturn game, it still hits the spot for me as a PlayStation kid. The title screen demo mode, the waving chequered flag in the menu background, the music, and the countdown to the race start all nail that 1990s aesthetic. As the name suggests, the game has you driving rally cars in parking garages. I initially thought I’d made a mistake buying it – the handling seemed simple to the point of boredom, there was no sense of speed, and the ghost cars all seemed to be miles ahead without any mistakes on my part. Drifting is the name of the game – I should have paid better attention to the tutorial! Then I realised how important drifting is. Hold X (on a controller) as your car veers around a bend and your tyres will squeal – but more importantly, you’ll build up a charge that allows you to slingshot yourself with a speed boost on corner exit. Chain a few drifts together and suddenly you’ll be pushing 100mph. After the first few levels, the circuits become more complex and you’ll need to memorise the course to know when to drift around blind corners. Each lap is a challenge in memory and split-second reactions to get – and stay – ahead. It’s an addictive experience more akin to a platformer than a racing game. Touring the USA There are eight circuits in total, themed around US cities from San Francisco to Boston. One of my favourites – albeit one of the most difficult to master – is the New York track, which features a jump over the crown of the Statue of Liberty. There’s plenty of variety, and some levels even mix things up with mid-race changes like rolling boulders or power cuts casting the track into darkness. My only small gripe with the circuit layouts and handling model is how easy it is to roll the car or end up off-course. Sometimes this is your own fault, but it can be frustrating when your entire run is ruined because of a particularly sharp edge or a ramp that launches you into obstacles or beyond the track limits at the top. The circuits are varied and challenging – New York is a particular highlight To unlock the next circuit, you must achieve at least a bronze trophy by beating a target time. When you’ve done all eight, you’ll unlock the next car class, which is faster and heavier. At the end of all three classes (24 events in total), you’re done, and any additional challenge comes from chasing gold in previous events. It took me two and a half hours to pass every race, but mastery would take much longer. When you earn a silver medal for a track, you also unlock Endurance mode, which is a checkpoint-based timed run. Again, I found battling against ghosts from the leaderboard to be extremely addictive – not least because this is a rare game where you have a chance at the global top spot if you get it right. Simple but addictive And that about sums it up. Parking Garage Rally Circuit is simple, short, sweet, and has enough depth in terms of medals and rankings to keep you playing well beyond your first run through its roster of events. I imagine this will fall into my rotation of fun little games to load up when I have 20 or 30 minutes to spare and don’t have the time to invest in a cinematic title with an elaborate story. The graphics, the music, and the gameplay all do a convincing job of emulating console games of the 1990s, to a degree where I could easily mistake this for a long-forgotten title pulled from my PlayStation collection. If you’re the kind of person who gets pulled in by “just one more go” games that test your memory and reactions, you’ll easily recoup your investment over a few hours. 4/5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/parking-garage-rally-circuit_1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/parking-garage-rally-circuit_1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">PlayStation 5 Pro and 30th anniversary limited editions</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/19/playstation-5-pro-30th-anniversary" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PlayStation 5 Pro and 30th anniversary limited editions" /><published>2024-09-19T01:00:01+01:00</published><updated>2024-09-19T01:00:01+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/19/playstation-5-pro-30th-anniversary</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="playstation" /><category term="industry" /><summary type="html">🎮 It’s been a busy month for Sony, who revealed both the PlayStation 5 Pro and a selection of retro grey consoles and accessories for PlayStation’s 30th anniversary.

It’s an odd predicament – perhaps unique to video games – and it’s one that Astro Bot blasts straight through. When you play this game, it’s impossible to think about anything except what’s on the screen. Astro Bot is a pure shot of fun and nostalgia from start to finish Much of that is due to the game’s retro simplicity – not in terms of difficulty, but in the premise and core gameplay: Astro Bot is on a level. He must get from Point A to Point B. There are obstacles in his way, either enemies or physical hurdles. You must find a way to overcome them, and have fun doing so. That’s it. There’s no grand narrative here. No jarring commentary on real-world issues, or mechanics that make you sigh and yearn for what gaming once was. The only time my mind drifted from the level before my eyes was to consider the choices behind its design, and my conclusion was usually something like: “The person at Team Asobi who made this really knows how to make a fun game!” Hopping through the galaxy The beauty of Astro Bot’s story is that it barely has one. 300 bots are riding in a spaceship shaped like a PlayStation 5 when it is attacked by an alien. It explodes, its parts and the bots scattered across the galaxy. The alien steals the CPU, and Astro Bot blasts off on his controller mini-ship to find the parts and his friends. There is one level per planet, with planets divided into star systems, each capped with a final boss and a stage themed around a beloved PlayStation game. Even exploring the galaxy map is a lot of fun, with secret levels to uncover and ships carrying collectables to chase. I couldn’t help but compare it to the expansive but much more sterile and borderline indecipherable map in Starfield. Far from glorified menus, even the star system screens have their secrets to uncover Each level has a handful of bots to save – some generic, some dressed up as characters from PlayStation history. When Astro finds them, they’re stowed inside his controller ship, and at the end of the level they’re sent back to the planet the ship crashed on, where the PS5 mothership’s carcass serves as the centrepiece of a museum full of all the bots you’ve discovered and rescued to date. The other main collectable is jigsaw puzzle pieces. While Astro’s Playroom used these to construct a pretty mural, Astro Bot gives them a much more practical application. Completing a smaller puzzle unlocks new functionality at the crash site – a hub to change outfits or give your ship a lick of paint, for example. Two-button challenge Astro Bot’s gameplay is just as simple: he can run, jump, use boosters in his feet, and hit enemies. Don’t let that fool you – there’s some challenging platforming to be found, both in the main levels towards the end of the game, but especially in unlockable gauntlet stages themed around the PlayStation symbols (you’ll be very thankful that your PS5’s SSD allows near-instant reloads upon death). While one mistake is usually enough to kill Astro, checkpoints are so frequent that you only ever lose a few seconds of progress. I was grateful for this as a way of reducing the risk when trying out a new mechanic or attempting an ambitious manoeuvre to reach some distant platform in search of treasure – vital in a game with so many secret areas and obscurely located bots to be rescued. Special abilities - like becoming a giant sponge - add variety across levels Many levels have a special upgrade, giving Astro a booster pack, an extended punch reach, or climbing abilities, for example. My favourites were a mod that enabled him to contract into a rolling ball a la Marble Blast, and a very creative stage that transformed him into a sponge, growing larger as he absorbed water. The levels themselves also have creative ideas that add variety and sometimes completely change the premise midway through – an ability that shrinks Astro to the size of a mouse and unlocks access to a miniscule level-within-a-level, for example, or an Arabian village level that morphs into a sandstorm hellscape once the player lets a genie out of his lamp to wreak chaos across the area. Retro futurism To me, Astro Bot is what I dreamt gaming might look like when I was playing back in the 1990s. Sure, I expected graphics to improve, but I also thought that the ideas would expand with them. Instead, we got technically sophisticated titles that look great but play like semi-interactive films (especially on PlayStation). Astro Bot might not look as lifelike as The Last of Us or God of War, but it is very crisp and smooth, which is important in a platformer. Where it really shines, though, is in its visual variety – there are grassy levels, snowy levels, underwater levels, spooky levels, retro Minecraft-esque levels where everything is made of tiny blocks… My favourite was an art deco casino stage that felt very Cuphead, complete with evil anthropomorphic cards throwing the rest of the deck at you. Slo-Mo Casino is so colourful and stylish that it was hard to choose just one screenshot Many games have themed sections, but Astro Bot’s attention to detail sets it apart. Sometimes it’s in the animation – for example, the way Astro skates and twirls along icy surfaces. Sometimes it’s the enemies, who are given accessories and abilities to match the level’s theme. And sometimes it’s the sheer number of objects on the screen – each gem, leaf, or gold nugget is a separate item with full physics, and the game revels in letting you smash through full piles of them. All of this is also extremely tactile. Astro Bot was built for the PS5’s controller, and makes better use of it than any other game I’ve played (edging out Gran Turismo 7, which does a solid job). You can sense each individual object and surface through its vibration, lending the world a very physical feel – especially in levels where Astro is curled up in a ball, rolling over panels adorned with spikes. Fun above all else While getting from A to B is the name of the game, Team Asobi has excelled at adding unique attractions for the player to investigate. These are usually clearly signposted, and whenever you find yourself asking “Can I do X?”, the answer is a resounding yes, rewarded by coins. Can I kick that football into the goal? Sure. Can I jump through the hoop with those dolphins? You bet – here’s your prize. Another favourite moment occurred on a snowy level, where I encountered two penguins building the base of a snowman. To my delight, Astro Bot was able to nudge the ball around the area and collect snow from the ground until he’d built a snowball bigger than himself. These might sound like inconsequential details, but they demonstrate how the developer prioritised fun above all else. Piles of objects like this are fully interactive - you can wade or smash through as you wish One more variation on the genre comes in those setups involving large numbers of objects and space to play with the physics. I mentioned that sometimes this means Astro wading through chest-high pits of items, but it can also be a pile of inflatables stacked precariously at the top of a water slide, or opening a compartment that dumps a squirrel’s entire store of acorns on Astro’s head. The fun continues on the crash planet, where certain areas and activities require tens, or even hundreds, of your rescued bots to chip in to lift heavy objects or form human ladders. It’s cute to see usually hostile faces like Psycho Mantis contribute to the effort, and some stunts and animations are wacky in and of themselves. If you’ve never seen 60 bots swing a pig by the tail, you haven’t lived. Branded brethren Aside from the gameplay, one of the most notable things about Astro Bot is how closely it is tied to the PlayStation brand. The objective of the entire game is to reconstruct a giant PS5, of course, and the novelty for many players will come from collecting characters and unlocking their trademark items and scenes – even if, classily, those individuals and their games are never directly named. That’s nice, but the more surprising nostalgia for me came from smaller details in the levels. The coins Astro collects (which always reminded me of chocolate coins) are stamped with the PlayStation logo. The save slots are PS1 memory cards. Some ropes and wires are PS1 controller extension cables, complete with chunky connectors. And – perhaps my giddiest discovery – even the raindrops in the spooky levels form the controller button symbols when they hit the ground. PlayStation symbology is often subtly woven into levels - like these triangle mushrooms PlayStation branding is often very plain. Its logo and trademarks are increasingly minimalist, and as the generations have gone on any remaining colour has been sucked out. Even the symbols on the PS5 controller are grey, abandoning their signature hues. Sony has little of the fun and vibrance of a brand like Nintendo. But when you take all those icons, restore their colour, and place them amid the bright, cutesy vibe of Astro Bot, it’s amazing what a difference it makes. This is the first time in years – perhaps decades – that the PlayStation brand has sparked any kind of wonder in me, and at times the throwbacks triggered the shot of adrenaline I used to enjoy watching that PS1 boot screen as a kid. Generational talent I wouldn’t want every game to be Astro Bot. There is room for more serious titles that try to look realistic and tackle impactful themes. But I would like more games to be like Astro Bot. Unless you have a Nintendo console or the stomach for sub-par kids’ games, it’s very rare for a game to be such all-out fun. It’s a refreshing way to switch off and focus entirely on gameplay, like I did 25 years ago. But Astro Bot took roughly 15 hours to play every level from start to finish. I’m not complaining about that – its RRP is lower than most games and I’d rather play a concise game of consistent quality than an endless collectathon – but it does mean that it’s too long to run on vibes alone. The gameplay has to match. Astro Bot's immense polish is likely a result of its deliberately constrained scope Team Asobi has delivered near-flawlessly in that department. Astro Bot’s controls are natural, consistent, and responsive – everything you need in a platformer where a split-second jump can have huge stakes – and the controller feedback elevates the experience to joyful levels. The controls are solid enough to support not only the casual explore-and-progress levels, but also the more challenging gauntlets that present one threat after another with zero thinking time. So the game plays well. It does things with the PS5 controller that no other game has. The graphics, while simple and bright, are crisp and polished. It’s all on the disc, with no live services or add-ons. And – perhaps most importantly – Astro Bot puts fun front and centre. Together, it’s the sum of its parts and then some, the most complete package we’ve had so far this generation. If you have a PS5, even if platformers aren’t your usual jam, I very much recommend you play it. 5/5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/astro-bot_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/astro-bot_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds - inspirational but sanitised</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/13/hideo-kojima-connecting-worlds" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hideo Kojima&amp;#58; Connecting Worlds &amp;#45; inspirational but sanitised" /><published>2024-09-13T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-09-13T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/13/hideo-kojima-connecting-worlds</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="death-stranding" /><category term="metal-gear-solid" /><category term="documentaries" /><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html">It’s no secret that Hideo Kojima likes attention, and I’m sure he would have loved the idea of Connecting Worlds, a film that is ultimately part-documentary, part-marketing exercise.

We’ve witnessed one of the most remarkable failures ever, as Concord - the Firewalk Studios-developed live service game into which Sony had invested so much in the hope it would be the next big thing - was shut down after just two weeks in operation. Much of the criticism of the title was written off by its supporters and the press as “hate”, but this story is actually a culmination of a number of factors that should not be swept under the carpet. If they are, then game developers and publishers might miss the important lessons that should be learnt from Concord’s demise.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concord_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concord_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Year In Between - my debut novel is available now!</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/02/the-year-in-between-novel" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Year In Between - my debut novel is available now!" /><published>2024-08-26T01:00:01+01:00</published><updated>2024-08-26T01:00:01+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/02/the-year-in-between-novel</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="the-year-in-between" /><category term="writing" /><category term="books" /><summary type="html">My first ever novel, The Year In Between, is now available for purchase! The book was a labour of love that took hundreds of hours to finish, but I’m aware that competition is fierce for your hard-earned money and the limited space on your bookshelf, so I’ve put together a short article to give you a better idea of the themes it explores and what to expect should you choose to read it.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/the-year-in-between_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/the-year-in-between_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">GTA IV’s Liberty City is still the best virtual city ever made</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/08/25/grand-theft-auto-iv-liberty-city" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GTA IV's Liberty City is still the best virtual city ever made" /><published>2024-08-25T01:00:01+01:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T01:00:01+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/08/25/grand-theft-auto-iv-liberty-city</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="grand-theft-auto" /><category term="retro" /><summary type="html">In its review upon the game’s release in 2008, GamesRadar called Liberty City “the biggest reason to delve into GTA IV”. Its writers said it was “easily 100 times more detailed” than the map of its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, concluding that altogether, the city was “convincingly like the real thing”. GTA IV tells story of Niko Bellic, but Liberty City has a life of its own It truly was like nothing we’d ever seen. Spanning three islands totalling just over six square miles, GTA IV’s map was nowhere near as expansive as the region depicted by Rockstar’s 2004 title, but it was perhaps the densest video game setting ever built in terms of population and detail - and certainly in character. For players focused on the story and the violence, many of the small touches that made Liberty City such a great virtual city probably passed by unnoticed. But even then, they undoubtedly felt that what they were playing was a premium product, even if they didn’t know why. My goal in this article is to pick apart those minutae that make GTA IV’s world such a compelling imitiation of a real-life city.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gta-iv_9.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gta-iv_9.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
