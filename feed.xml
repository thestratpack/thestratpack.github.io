&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that Silverstone is the pinnacle of UK motorsport venues, but Brands Hatch really stands out among the mid-tier circuits hosting events smaller than &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; Grands Prix. Its facilities are far better than I was expecting the first time I visited, but its beauty comes in its views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike circuits like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/08/29/btcc-formula-4-thruxton/&quot;&gt;Thruxton&lt;/a&gt;, which have only a few spectator areas, at Brands Hatch fans are allowed to walk the full perimeter of the track - and the differences in elevation between the various sections mean that often the majority of the course is visible from any individual spot you settle on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a complete view is what you’re after, the main grandstand on the main straight is the spot for you. Sitting atop Paddock Hill, these seats give great views down into Turn 1, with the more distant Druids hairpin to your left, Graham Hill bend straight ahead, and Clearways to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get closer to the action, Brands Hatch has you covered in that respect, too. Pictured is the view standing right next to the fence at the start line, but the other top spot for motorsport fans who like to smell the oil and hear the tyres squeal is Druids - cross the footbridge and you can stand right on the inside of the hairpin, metres away from the cars.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less-explored parts of the circuit also give great views. The photo below was taken from a little verge on the Southbank, where you can watch the drivers exit Druids and head down through Graham Hill bend - and even from there you can still keep an eye on what’s happening up at Paddock Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading back in the other direction, there are also good angles to be found around Surtees, Clearways, and Clark Curve, which are often the scene of intense on-track battles and spins (even more so on wet days like Saturday) as drivers test their cars’ limits around these long, fast corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s worth mentioning that Formula Ford uses Brands Hatch’s Indy configuration. Events with faster cars use the Grand Prix circuit, which doubles the length of the lap and opens up many more potential viewing spots, even if it removes the aforementioned complete visibility factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brands-hatch-formula-ford_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one downside, and the thing that will stop me visiting as often as I otherwise might, is that the circuit’s transport links are in decline. Buses between Swanley station and Brands Hatch have been cut back, leaving only a five-hour window between the first and last buses, and the last bus didn’t even turn up on Saturday, forcing me to take a taxi to get home. With fewer and less reliable buses, taxis are now the only option, really reducing Brands Hatch’s affordability as a day out for those of us without cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, when you can get there, it’s definitely worth it to spend a day wandering around the track and taking in the views from different corners. No other circuit I’ve been to has come close in terms of variety and just how picturesque the whole place is. So if you want to watch motorsport but don’t know where to start, give Brands Hatch a go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="motorsport" /><category term="formula-ford" /><summary type="html">I went to Brands Hatch this weekend to see some of the action at the 50th Formula Ford Festival.

Having used it extensively for everything from gaming, to work, to writing a novel, here are my thoughts on Razer’s mid-range model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aesthetics&quot;&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition out of its pristine packaging (seriously, they give Apple a run for their money in that department), the first thing you’ll notice is that it’s an extremely neat little package. The absence of the number pad reduces the length, and the minimalist metal board gives it both a nice weight and a straightforward look. The keyboard comes with a detachable USB-C cable, which is a little stiff and difficult to lay flat, but is as high-quality as everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEDs are nice and bright, as expected, and the function keys (the most useful of which are the audio controls) light up alone when the Fn key is held, which is a nice touch. The function icons themselves are printed onto the keys, rather than transparent sections that allow the light from the LEDs through, which is a slightly odd design choice and confused me once or twice early on. That might be due to the positioning of the lights, but it means you won’t be able to see which key does what in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months down the line and the only other comment to make here is about dust. All black devices collect dust, and the Huntsman Tournament Edition is no exception. The spaces between some of the keys are too small to brush dust off with your finger, so you’ll want a nice cloth to get in there properly. Also, the keys are too sensitive to clean the keyboard when the computer is on (more on that later). I clean it every couple of weeks and the dust doesn’t bother me in between, but this may not be the keyboard for you if you like everything to be pristine all the time.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you plug the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition into your computer for the first time, you’ll be prompted to install the Razer Synapse software. This is a requirement if you want to run some of the fancier LED setups, like reflecting the colours on the screen or running custom colours for individual keys. However, it has to run all the time and there are stories all over the internet of it using a strange amount of CPU compute time and RAM for such a simple utility. In short, it’s bloatware, and I quickly wanted rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the in-box documentation doesn’t tell you is that you can configure LED colours without running Razer Synapse. By pressing Fn, Ctrl, and the number keys, you can select from a range of modes (yes, that includes the rainbow scheme and the &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style keys that light up when you press them). Tapping the number key repeatedly will cycle through different key colours. Finally, press Fn and tap the menu key to cycle through colours for the function keys. It’s certainly more limited, but it’s enough for me and it’s certainly better than needing to run dedicated keyboard software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usability&quot;&gt;Usability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is very satisfying to type on, both to the touch and to the ear. The red Razer linear optical switches provide an almost instant response when you press a key, while still managing to deliver a satisfying (and loud) clack when the key reaches the bottom of its trajectory. You don’t need to be playing first-person shooters to feel the benefit, either - it’s just as nice to feel that extra bit of control when moving the camera around in &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/transport-fever&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Just don’t bring it to the office - your colleagues won’t be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With great responsiveness comes great sensitivity, and the negative segments of most reviews I read prior to buying the Huntsman Tournament Edition focused on the frustrations this can bring. Sure enough, in the first week or so using this keyboard I would occasionally mistype by lightly brushing keys by accident. But it didn’t take long to adapt and become more deliberate in my key presses, and now those mistakes are a lot rarer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At £130 (minus an extra discount if you sign up to the Razer newsletter), the Huntsman Tournament Edition is a great option for anyone looking for a first mechanical keyboard. As a complete package, it saves the confusion and expense of purchasing the board, switches, and keycaps separately, while still allowing for some customisation - different caps, switches, and cables can all be bought and fitted to apply your choice of colour scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LED setup has a worthy range of settings, even without installing the accompanying software, and - most importantly - the keyboard is a pleasure to type on. Complaints about sensitivity have been overstated elsewhere - you will get used to it - and it’s a small price to pay for a hyper-responsive keyboard with a neat little form factor and top-quality hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="hardware" /><summary type="html">It’s been a few months since I delved into the world of mechanical keyboards for the first time with the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition - a little black number with a hugely customisable LED setup and super-responsive keys.

The last entry I played at any length was &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt;, the then-next-gen PS2 title that hit the shelves in 2001, so I fired up the emulator and got racing. What was I looking for? Well, I’m sure later games had many improvements, but I wanted to revisit my own memories of the series and see whether the magic remained, or whether my enthusiasm for next year’s release is based on pure nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-the-racing&quot;&gt;Part I: The racing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the heart of the matter: the racing. The first thing you’ll notice is that &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; brushes up pretty well graphically. There’s not much going on outside the white lines and some circuits hide that better than others, but the tracks themselves have plenty of character and despite occasionally looking a bit flat (forgivable on the PS2) the cars - particularly the rear of your own car, which you’ll see plenty of - look great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game touts itself as a simulator, but takes a surprisingly arcadey approach. Although there is an option to qualify, the default route drops you straight into the race at the back of the grid and with no time to learn the track. Adding to this atmosphere is the soundtrack, which plays as you drive and includes some Feeder, an obscure early Muse track, and a couple of songs that sound like they were ripped from a &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fight scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls are simple: X to accelerate and square to brake. I found the steering a little twitchy, better managed with careful taps on the D-pad rather than the analogue stick. Cars have a habit of oversteering and requiring opposite lock for correction - momentum is the name of the game here, and you’ll want to avoid drifts and brushes with the barriers and the AI to maintain it. &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; is at its best when you hit a flow state and can throw the car around the corners while maintaining speed and stability.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worthy of a mention here is the force feedback, which does a fantastic job of communicating grip, movement, and textures like rumble strips. The subtlety of the system is amazing when compared even to later games. Reflections Interactive’s 2002 game &lt;em&gt;Stuntman&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has an almost binary vibration system which seemingly only activates under wheelspin. Compared to that, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; is like a symphony for your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI is typical of racing games at the time. If your car is powerful enough, you can take multiple places before the end of the first straight and move up to second, but the leading car is almost always perfectly tuned to give you a run for your money. It’s usually faster than you in a straight line, meaning the player has to take corners perfectly to bring home the win. This raises the stakes, and often the entire race is a tense battle for first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other drivers fight hard… Except they’re not really fighting - the AI is on rails, it hunts as a pack, and it will not think twice about ramming into you if you’re on its racing line. Given the immovable nature of vehicles in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt;, this can have a huge bearing on your race. If you’re in a mild spin, these shunts can either knock you back up to speed or leave you facing the wrong way, unable to salvage any positions. There are no in betweens, and when this gets in the way and effectively ends your race it’s infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-the-tracks&quot;&gt;Part II: The tracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracks in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; are mainly fictional. Laguna Seca and Côte d’Azur (Monaco) are the only real-world circuits and I think that is to the game’s benefit. The original tracks have a great flow with a lot of blind and flat-out corners, plus usually one or two tricky turns that deliver that little jolt of adrenaline when you finally take them just right. Whoever created these should be designing the modern &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; tracks! They certainly have a lot more challenge and character than Sochi or Yas Marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are three duds for me. At one end of the spectrum are the Test Track and Super Speedway, which are ovals that essentially require you to hold down the X button until your finger aches, although admittedly the latter does have more challenging turns. The other extreme is Special Stage Route 11, a track so complex (and where the AI is so overpowered) that just seeing the name on a cup schedule strikes fear into my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting design element to point out is that the fictional tracks do a great job of warning you about what’s ahead through in-game road signs. Although the tracks borrow some elements from real-life circuits, nobody knows Mid-Field Raceway or Grand Valley Speedway like they might know Silverstone or Suzuka when they play &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, so this is a useful addition when you’re thrown into a race at a new circuit. It’s a neat trick that retains more challenge and immersion than the now-common on-track racing line or arcade-style HUD icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-gran-turismo-mode&quot;&gt;Part III: Gran Turismo mode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The showpiece of the game, and where any sane person will spend most of their time, is Gran Turismo mode. The setup is simple: Armed with a mere 20,000 credits, you must buy a car, compete in races, and use the winnings to either upgrade your existing vehicle or buy a new one. Rinse and repeat until you own the car of your dreams and can compete in the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/16/pro-evolution-soccer-5-master-league&quot;&gt;the old &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; Master League&lt;/a&gt;, this makes for a classic gameplay loop. And also much like the old &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; Master League, you’ll have to battle with some confusingly poor menu translation along the way. That’s more than made up for, however, by the satisfaction of installing new parts that win you races and the jazzy music so typical of Japanese games of this era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those upgrades don’t just provide a speed improvement - the game does a really good job of conveying power through changes to engine sounds. And while in other racing games dominating the field can leave you wondering whether you should up the difficulty or rebalance the car, in &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; it’s simply super gratifying to know you’re out in front because you’ve engineered that Mazda RX-7 to within an inch of its life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The byproduct of all this customisation is a steep difficulty curve. Your supercharged starter car will have plenty of power, but awful handling. At this point, every corner becomes a near-spin and you may find yourself having to grind out credits, too slow to win but too poor to buy a better car. But that’s the beauty of &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; - races and cups feel more like levels in other game genres than serious simulated competitions, and multiple attempts are required at each before you can take home the trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_8.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of challenges, some races require you to have earned particular racing licences in order to enter. Each licence consists of a series of tests, from driving in a straight line and stopping in a marked area to completing a fast lap of a circuit in the rain. I was expecting these to be more of a grind, but they’re actually a nice way to break things up and try some different cars early in the game. For the perfectionists, there are three pass grades, but scoring anything better than bronze takes some serious effort and I can imagine you’d go mad trying to 100 per cent all the licence tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running through an emulator, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt;’s graphics are more than passable, and the gameplay is a classic “easy to learn, impossible to master” affair. Add to that the variety of racing on offer (I haven’t even mentioned the endurance and rally events here), a set of refreshing original tracks, and a huge variety of parts to install and setup options to tweak, and you have plenty to keep you occupied as you work your way up the tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity and propensity to drift sometimes gets a little bit much, and the aforementioned shunts from the AI will leave you raging when they ruin your race on the last corner, but there’s always a feeling that you might have done a little bit better - avoided a spin, given opponents more space, or taken a better line. While the AI cars might have been given less weight, it’s forgivable because the capability just wasn’t there for anything much better 20 years ago. Most racing games of the time took a similar approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_11.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/16/pro-evolution-soccer-5-master-league&quot;&gt;my look back at &lt;em&gt;Pro Evolution Soccer 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that my favourite games take on some realistic features, but more importantly ensure they have a solid gameplay loop and are fun to play. &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; also falls into this category. Gran Turismo mode is an addictive cycle of racing, reward, and progression that drives you to replay the same cup races over and over until you succeed. It’s a formula like no other racing game - you won’t get the same thing in &lt;em&gt;F1 2021&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/project-cars&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Cars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 3&lt;/em&gt; stands up surprisingly well two decades after its release. This is a package that has plenty to keep me playing &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/21/gran-turismo-7-campaign-mode/&quot;&gt;until &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; arrives&lt;/a&gt; - it’s simply addictive. And if I was ever to get bored with Polyphony Digital’s latest offering, it might just inspire me to explore the &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; games in between that I missed first time around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="racing" /><category term="gran-turismo" /><summary type="html">With Gran Turismo 7 on the horizon, I thought now seemed like a good time to revisit an earlier game in the series.

There’s not much going on outside the white lines and some circuits hide that better than others, but the tracks themselves have plenty of character and despite occasionally looking a bit flat (forgivable on the PS2) the cars - particularly the rear of your own car, which you’ll see plenty of - look great. The game touts itself as a simulator, but takes a surprisingly arcadey approach. Although there is an option to qualify, the default route drops you straight into the race at the back of the grid and with no time to learn the track. Adding to this atmosphere is the soundtrack, which plays as you drive and includes some Feeder, an obscure early Muse track, and a couple of songs that sound like they were ripped from a Matrix fight scene. The controls are simple: X to accelerate and square to brake. I found the steering a little twitchy, better managed with careful taps on the D-pad rather than the analogue stick. Cars have a habit of oversteering and requiring opposite lock for correction - momentum is the name of the game here, and you’ll want to avoid drifts and brushes with the barriers and the AI to maintain it. Gran Turismo 3 is at its best when you hit a flow state and can throw the car around the corners while maintaining speed and stability.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/10/granturismo3_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Running is like F1 for your feet</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/running-formula-1-for-your-feet" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Running is like F1 for your feet" /><published>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-10-10T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/running-formula-1-for-your-feet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratpack.blog//2021/10/10/running-formula-1-for-your-feet">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I did a lot of running. I’d wake up early in the week and head out for an hour or so, then go even further on weekends. Part of my reason for running was the therapeutic element - it was the only time I’d be alone with no screens, headphones, or other distractions. Another factor was that I was (and am) a data junkie, and tracking my pace and distance through an app and pushing myself to go further was a minor obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my peak I made it to half marathon distances, and my long weekend runs would be jaunts from my suburb into the middle of the city and back. I remember remarking to a friend at the time that running “felt like &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; for my feet”. He laughed it off, focusing on the absurdity of the statement rather than the logic behind it. As time went on, the cold months drew in, and I got busier with work, my running dropped off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years later, COVID-19 happened. I went from dragging a heavy bag around the city, jumping between offices and trains and bars, to sitting in my desk chair pretty much all day every day. To get at least some exercise, I returned to regular running over short distances, and when my enthusiasm began to wane in 2021, I signed up to provide some motivation. Back out on the pavements, it wasn’t long until the analogy came to mind once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/running_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people don’t appreciate the strategic element of Formula 1 (and therefore definitely wouldn’t like &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/motorsport-manager&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorsport Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Behind all the rivalries, battles, and crashes is a subtle game of chess. The name of this game is pace management - drivers and teams must carefully control how hard they’re pushing at any time to prolong the life of their tyres and ensure they have enough fuel to finish. Raw pace alone might grab pole position in qualifying, but it won’t win (or perhaps even finish) the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels with running are numerous. My legs take a while to warm up. I only have a finite amount of energy to expend. And if my route features an uphill section then I better not push too hard in the flat areas. When I leave my flat for any particular run I need to keep all this in mind, along with the length of the run itself. If I’m heading out for a midweek 5km run I know I can push hard throughout, but on a weekend 10km run I need to hold myself back and conserve energy to run further at a slower pace.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/running_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is twice as challenging at an organised event. Running in a pack, there’s an automatic tendency to push to keep up with others who are either faster or aren’t pacing themselves properly. If you don’t maintain your own pace and monitor your interval times, you’ll exhaust yourself before the end. Even if it feels like you’re losing out, the other runners are on different strategies. As an F1 engineer would say over the radio: “We’re not racing them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when it’s a just nice jog around the neighbourhood as the sun rises, your typical running app offers a wealth of stats for geeks like us. Comparing interval times from around your route, elevation, average pace, and so on is a fascinating bonus on top of the exercise itself and can provide great feedback to help on future runs. That said, don’t let it put you off - running can be as complex as you want to make it, but getting started is as easy as throwing on a pair of trainers and getting outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="running" /><category term="formula-1" /><summary type="html">A few years ago, I did a lot of running.

Gone was &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/pro-evolution-soccer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro Evolution Soccer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the stalwart of slower, more considered football gaming. In its place we were to be given a free-to-play, cross-platform title in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/efootball.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;eFootball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change, the skeptics warned, was a downgrade designed to unite PC, console, and mobile players and cash in on microtransactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to comment on eFootball 2022’s economics, but luckily its free-to-play format meant I could try out its gameplay without spending a penny. After a fair few games I can say that it’s not quite as bad as the graphical glitch memes would have you believe, but it’s much worse than last year’s &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; and, technically, a long way from being ready for the public to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few good ideas in there. The fluid ball collection system, where players will collect the ball to set up for set pieces without the usual fade to black, is a nice touch. But as with many &lt;em&gt;eFootball&lt;/em&gt; features, it’s prone to confusing failures. The most common for me was a player setting up for a corner while the camera stayed static, stuck looking at the penalty area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konami has also tried to apply some of &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s pre-match gloss with a new kit and lineup selection interface that does away with basic menus and builds these options into scenes of the teams arriving, warming up, and walking out of the tunnel. It’s a bit slow to have to do every time you play a match, but it does a good job of showing the atmosphere in the ground building up.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all know the most important part of any football game how it plays on the pitch, and it’s here that &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; lets us down irredeemably. The game is so rough around the edges that it’s essentially an alpha at this point, but even then there are many features mysteriously missing that probably wouldn’t require any effort for the developers to implement beyond adjusting a few variables. There are only two difficulty levels available, for example, and it’s impossible to play a match longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the supposed engine upgrade, the graphics are a definite step back from previous &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; titles. The stadiums actually look fine (although they have a startlingly loud new announcer who sounds like a random passer by at Konami HQ was asked to read bizarre lines like: “Smoking is only permitted in designated areas within these grounds” - what?!). But the pitch scenes, which you’ll be spending most of your time looking at, are so flat and lacking in detail that they are reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; games from ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other visual changes include a new default camera that zooms in on action on the near side of the pitch, seemingly to show off the dearth of detail. This makes it hard to pick out passes more than a couple of metres away, and after a game or two I quickly switched to the classic Wide view. There’s also an odd choice to show a circle on the ground under the active player - something that persists even in some cut scenes. This is a feature last seen on a console in &lt;em&gt;FIFA 2001&lt;/em&gt;, and is a jarring addition for a game that proclaims its realism and would probably like to avoid comparisons to mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing is key to football, and it’s horribly broken here. Opponents are absolute pros at interceptions - you won’t be threading any eye-of-the-needle balls through the defence because they desperately lunge at anything that moves, even in safe areas of the pitch. While that could be written off as an increase in difficulty, passing itself is horrifically slow. Recent &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt; titles have always offered an alternative to &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s ping-pong exchanges, but even at maximum power it’s impossible to play a quick pass to a teammate. Only through balls seem to have any momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that even if you do play a perfect pass to a man in space, it’s likely that a defender has moved to cover him by the time the ball arrives. And even when the ball gets to the recipient, you’re not out of the woods yet. Players have an infuriating habit of forgetting the ball at key moments and simply running past it, leaving it for the defender to collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the passes, nothing to the game feels like it has any weight to it. Shooting in particular is deeply unsatisfying. Even a shot from the most stable of positions in acres of space feels like a snatched, scuffed attempt at goal taken on the turn. The knock-on effect is that goals feel more a result of coincidence than skill, depriving players of what is meant to be the high of the football game experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re perfectly happy to battle both the opponent and the controls, you’ll also have to fight the game engine itself. Despite downgrade the graphics have received, the game frequently stutters, especially during cut scenes, which run at a criminally low frame rate (and also, for some reason, you now have to press A or X twice to skip them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/efootball6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was to choose a word to describe &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; in its current state, it would be bland. Konami worked so hard over recent years to bring some fluidity and excitement back to &lt;em&gt;PES&lt;/em&gt;, and it has all been undone in one new iteration. They have apologised and promised to take players’ feedback onboard in future patches, but it’s hard to see it would ever be possible match &lt;em&gt;PES 2021&lt;/em&gt; with such shaky foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planning to write a full review of &lt;em&gt;eFootball 2022&lt;/em&gt; once the Master League DLC arrived, but if the gameplay hasn’t significantly improved by then (and that would take such an overhaul that I don’t see how it can without a U-turn to revert to the FOX Engine) then I won’t be spending a penny on this game, and in its current format you shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="pro-evolution-soccer" /><category term="efootball" /><category term="football" /><summary type="html">eFootball 2022 rang alarm bells as soon as it was announced.

You’re dropped into a map dotted with small towns, resources, and factories and tasked with building the road, rail, sea, and air infrastructure that connects them to help the world’s economy to develop. With the same scenario and toolset, it’s a comparison that would inevitably be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a dangerous game for Urban Games to play with the original &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/transport-fever.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transport Fever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Transport Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; so beloved and its upgraded iteration &lt;em&gt;OpenTTD&lt;/em&gt; compatible with modern PCs, anything short of brilliance would be met with indifference. That’s not to mention that this is a fully 3D game. How many classic series have stuttered when moving to the third dimension? I’m looking at you, &lt;em&gt;RollerCoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, I approached &lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; with caution, ready to be let down. But I’m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. While this latest outing in the transport management genre is far from perfect, it has provided me with many hours of enjoyment, and - at least in its best moments - can be as satisfying as anything that came before it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After selecting a map seed you’re happy with, your new transport company is established, given a loan, and left to link the various cities and industries on a map with passenger and cargo lines. The latter is generally a more reliable income source and can be used to level up cities by providing them with goods they have demand for. However, it also requires complex supply chains - the city requires food, the food factory requires grain, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge lies in doing this while generating a profit. Is it better to focus on passengers or cargo? Should you upgrade your existing line or build a new one? Would a new bus route bring more passengers to the train station? The choices you make - especially in the early game - will be the difference between success and failure.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds a bit simple, it’s also worth noting that the creators over on the Steam Workshop have done a great job with modding the game beyond its vanilla setup. There are all sorts to choose from, but I’d especially recommend Realistic Town Growth, which removes the game’s arbitrary limit on how large any individual town can grow and lets you encourage some huge metropolises to grow by boosting industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there’s plenty of fun to be had with the base game. While the core challenge of building a network and generating a profit is fairly straightforward, committed players will find plenty to occupy themselves with, whether that involves imposing your own limitations, specialising in particular vehicles or industries, encouraging cities to grow in picturesque ways, or efficiently using your infrastructure for multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-toolset&quot;&gt;The toolset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you achieve all this, &lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; provides tools to build transport networks across four domains: road, rail, sea, and air. Within each category, the tools provided generally include tracks/roads of varying speeds, passenger and cargo stations, vehicle depots, signals, and waypoints (which can be used to direct vehicles to particular places without using stations - useful for implementing one-way systems and the like). These tools are generally reliable and an improvement on previous titles in the genre, although they can be slightly finnicky at times - espcially when it comes to elevation, bridges, and merging different tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the infrastructure is down, the next step is to purchase some vehicles. The available vehicles depend on the region you chose when starting the game (Europe, America, or Asia) and the in-game year. Over a span of more than a century, technology will progress from the horse and cart to the latest high-speed trains and aircraft. On purchasing a vehicle, you must assign it to a line, which tells it which stations to visit, which goods to pick up or drop off, how long to wait for a load, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to run a test game to start with to figure all this out, as the most efficient ways to solve problems are not always immediately obvious (more on this later). But once you’ve got the hang of it, it can be immensely satisfying to construct and configure complex networks for passengers and goods. Once you’ve got high-speed passenger trains seamlessly sharing lines with assorted cargo trains, you’ll waste plenty of time just sitting back and watching it all work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that alongside all the usual tools, the game also gives you close control over progression. While the normal three-speed time control is present, &lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; also has a slider for date speed. This means that if, like me, you find the eras pass a bit too quickly, you can slow down the calendar at any time to give you a bit more time to develop your network before you need to upgrade vehicles and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-difficulty&quot;&gt;The difficulty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is often the case in this genre, the most difficult part of &lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; is getting started. Your new transport is automatically granted a $5m loan, and your early decisions will play a huge part in determining whether this investment is used to generate huge profit or send your firm tumbling further into debt. Much of the early game is spent balancing network expansion with loan repayments (which come in $500k increments) and it’s a satisfying moment when your loan debt reaches zero and you know that from there on there is no more interest to pay and all your profit is yours to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the midpoint, you’ll find yourself choosing between tactical construction and upgrades. Take that passenger line you built in the 1890s, for example - would it be more profitable to extend it with an extra station or to invest in more modern trains that cater to more passengers and travel more quickly? The bottom toolbar displays a constant counter of how much money you’re making, and you’ll be looking to boost this figure as much as possible to propel yourself into the realm of airports and shinkansen later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late game is either a cruise or an exercise in firefighting, depending on how much planning you put in earlier on. If you played it smart, this is where you get to play with all the fancy toys like the high-speed planes, aircraft, and container ships. If you were less tactical when building your empire, there’ll probably be a lot of remediation on your plate as your infrastructure groans under the weight of the additional demand of expanding city populations and industry output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the vanilla game with the default difficulty, it’s not exactly difficult to work yourself into a situation where you’re raking in tens of millions per month and are basically free to build whatever you wish. Maybe that sounds like a dream to you if you just want to build to your heart’s content (and the game does also offer a complete sandbox mode with unlimited money), but if you’re looking for a bigger challenge then there’s always hard mode and the aforementioned mods if you want to mix things up for more of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vibe&quot;&gt;The vibe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you even get to enjoying the game, prepare for some pretty hefty load times. That may sound like an exaggeration, but seriously, if you want to get a coffee, load up the game first. Although there are no loading screens during the game, the initial one takes so long that I’ve written this paragraph and checked my takeaway delivery status in the time it has taken the game to load in. Seriously, it may even be the longest I’ve ever encountered in a game - and that includes &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll quickly notice that the game is very pretty to look at with a level of detail that is rare for a strategy game. Many of the screenshots included with this review aren’t representative of the zoom level where you’ll spend most of your time, but that’s because the cities look so good at street level and the vehicles are so detailed up close that I needed to show them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the game has funky music with some truly jazzy guitar. At its best, it channels something between &lt;em&gt;Sim City 2000&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;, but over time it can become grating. I say “by default” because I prompty turned it off, but hey, maybe it’s your kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only other thing to mention is to be prepared to be frustrated from time to time. Electric train won’t leave the depot? It could be that the depot itself is not electrified and must be demolished and rebuilt (and to demolish it, you’ll need to sell your new train). Ship won’t join your new route? There’s an accessibility issue somewhere - maybe the water isn’t deep enough at some points or there’s not a suitable dock - but the game won’t tell you what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is frequently the case with production, shipment, and transportation metrics when working with industry. A facility will stop producing a certain material and you’ll be left to work backwards to understand why. Months of in-game time and millions of dollars later, it’ll turn out that you accidentally demolished ten metres of road that took a factory out of range of a truck stop. You’ll get used to running these kinds of diagnostics in the end, but it can be very confusing as a new player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-judgement&quot;&gt;The judgement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; does what many games before it have failed at - transferring a classic 2D game format into 3D while keeping things both practical and aesthetically pleasing. By the time you reach the 21st century, you’ll have constructed a sprawling network of buses, trams, trains, ships, and planes, and the game’s graphics are good enough to let you sit back and admire it like the prettiest of virtual model train sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the systems and tooling is a little rough around the edges. While the complexity of roads and tracks allows for a little leeway on their construction tools, it would be nice if the developers provided the player with more information about why certain lines and industries aren’t working when problems arise. That said, you’ll slowly learn the language of the game and the key things to look out for, so this isn’t a gamebreaker for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get bored with whatever you’re currently working on, there’s always another line to build, a more challenging map to generate, a new region to try, or a railway spaghetti junction to reconfigure, so running out of content is not a concern - and that’s without mentioning all the mods out there that add new systems, vehicles, and more to keep things fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; lacks some of the charm of &lt;em&gt;Transport Tycoon&lt;/em&gt;, but we’re not talking about the chasm between &lt;em&gt;RollerCoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Planet Coaster&lt;/em&gt;. The core gameplay loop that made Chris Sawyer’s classic so addictive is still there. So if you’re looking to scratch that itch, I’d definitely recommend this game - just expect a few minor frustrations along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="transport-fever" /><category term="management" /><summary type="html">Let’s face the facts: Transport Fever 2 is a lot like Transport Tycoon. You’re dropped into a map dotted with small towns, resources, and factories and tasked with building the road, rail, sea, and air infrastructure that connects them to help the world’s economy to develop. With the same scenario and toolset, it’s a comparison that would inevitably be drawn. This was a dangerous game for Urban Games to play with the original Transport Fever. With Transport Tycoon so beloved and its upgraded iteration OpenTTD compatible with modern PCs, anything short of brilliance would be met with indifference. That’s not to mention that this is a fully 3D game. How many classic series have stuttered when moving to the third dimension? I’m looking at you, RollerCoaster Tycoon. With all this in mind, I approached Transport Fever 2 with caution, ready to be let down. But I’m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. While this latest outing in the transport management genre is far from perfect, it has provided me with many hours of enjoyment, and - at least in its best moments - can be as satisfying as anything that came before it. The challenge After selecting a map seed you’re happy with, your new transport company is established, given a loan, and left to link the various cities and industries on a map with passenger and cargo lines. The latter is generally a more reliable income source and can be used to level up cities by providing them with goods they have demand for. However, it also requires complex supply chains - the city requires food, the food factory requires grain, and so on. The challenge lies in doing this while generating a profit. Is it better to focus on passengers or cargo? Should you upgrade your existing line or build a new one? Would a new bus route bring more passengers to the train station? The choices you make - especially in the early game - will be the difference between success and failure.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_4.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog//wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_4.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What if Football Manager was a tabletop game?</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog//2020/09/07/eleven-football-management-tabletop-game/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What if Football Manager was a tabletop game?" /><published>2021-09-07T18:30:36+01:00</published><updated>2021-09-07T18:30:36+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog//2020/09/07/eleven-football-manager-tabletop-game</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratpack.blog//2020/09/07/eleven-football-management-tabletop-game/">&lt;p&gt;What if &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/football-manager.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Football Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t a computer game you play alone in front of a screen until the early hours of the morning, but a physical product you could reach out an touch with your hands?

No, I hadn’t considered it until now either, but it turns out that’s exactly what &lt;em&gt;Eleven&lt;/em&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polish developer Portal Games’s football management tabletop &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gamefound.com/projects/portalgames/eleven-football-manager-board-game&quot;&gt;has just opened for funding on Gamefound&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time of writing it’s sitting pretty at 500 per cent of its funding target (about €150,000) with 19 days remaining. So it seems that while &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had never thought of playing &lt;em&gt;Football Manager&lt;/em&gt; with dice and cards, it’s an experience people are hungry for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eleven_football_manager.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven&lt;/em&gt; describes itself as “an economic strategy board game”, which is an elaborate way of describing a game that lets you roleplay as a football manager. You and up to three friends will be bringing in players, choosing tactics, developing stadiums, signing up sponsors, and all that are typical of the coach-come-CEO role that only exists in gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base game comes in at €60, which is &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; reasonable given the number of pieces it looks like it comes with. What I was surprised at, however, is that the game is already launching with a range of five expansions, all priced at €20, which feels a little bit like the monetisation tactics of a cash-in mobile game, or what Konami is trying to do with &lt;em&gt;eFootball&lt;/em&gt;. I just ordered the Solo Campaign expansion because my friends aren’t really into football so I’ll mainly be playing alone, but if you want everything the game has to offer on release day you’re looking at a €128 outlay (plus postage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Eleven&lt;/em&gt; any good? Well, the YouTubers on the campaign page seemed to enjoy their preview copies enough, but of course they would.

Three key metrics - Production, Shipment, and Transport - are the root cause of many of these annoying issues, and my goal with this article is to explain exactly what they are to help anyone who is also stuck staring at them and wondering why they won’t increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which of these figures you’re having trouble with, one key thing to remember is that they can take a little while to ramp up, even when you’ve solved the problem that was holding your industry back. So don’t expect the metrics to shoot up as soon as you make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into the nitty gritty of these numbers, a note on factory levels: If you can keep production, shipment, and transport in the section at the right-hand end of the counters, the Level bar will start to move up. When it crosses the next threshold, the factory will expand. It will require more resources, but if supplied with adequate materials it will also produce a greater volume of goods. This can be an effective way of satisfying demand without building additional transportation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_industry_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;production&quot;&gt;Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production, as the name would suggest, indicates how many units of a certain product a facility is &lt;em&gt;producing&lt;/em&gt;. The food processing plant in the example above produces one food unit for every two units of grain it receives, and is operating at a production level of 190/200.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, product is driven by supply and not demand. To increase food production to 200, all I would need to do is supply more grain, perhaps by sourcing it from additional farms. This is true regardless of whether there are onward transport links to consumers. For example, if you were to supply a completely isolated food factory with grain, it would pay to receive the materials and produce food - that food would just disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shipment&quot;&gt;Shipment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipment indicates how many units of a particular product are &lt;em&gt;shipped&lt;/em&gt; from the facility. This is reflective of how much demand there is for these goods at the destination city, and is also capped by the current level of production. This complexity makes it slightly more difficult to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot, shipment is 91. Production is 190, so we know it’s not being capped by the input. The city receiving the food is Kobe, and by opening the city dialogue box we can see that its food supply is currently 105/97. This explains our shipment figure - the amount of food required by the destination city is only a fraction of what the factory is able to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_industry_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the city demand looks fine, it’s worth checking your transport links. Shipment levels will fall if there is no route from the producing facility to the destination. I once saw oil production and shipment fall off a cliff because I had accidentally deleted a road that made the drop-off truck stop accessible to the refinery. Rebuilding 10m of road saved an entire industry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transport&quot;&gt;Transport&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Transport is the percentage of the shipped units that make it to their destination. Ideally, this should always be 100 per cent - if it’s not, you’ve got a problem somewhere along the line holding things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, it’s rare to see a low Transport figure on an established line, and if there were issues then you’d likely have spotted them already because, well, the whole game is about transportation! One scenario that may catch you out, however, is if a factory levels up or a city’s demand increases due to growth and more goods are shipped than the line was originally designed for. In this case, you might need to introduce additional vehicles, or increase the capacity of those that are already running.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="transport-fever" /><category term="management" /><summary type="html">In my Transport Fever 2 review I wrote about the how the game sometimes frustrates by leaving you guessing as to why a line isn’t working or a factory isn’t producing goods.

I’ve had enough of that since 2020, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thruxton_1.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Saturday I visited, the main event was qualifying for the British Touring Car Championship, with support series including Formula 4 filling out the programme for the day. This essentially amounted to back-to-back sessions from 9am to past 6pm with the exception of an hour-long lunch break, which I say is pretty good value for the £14 entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thruxton itself is an entirely different circuit to &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/26/exploring-brands-hatch-at-the-formula-ford-festival/&quot;&gt;Brands Hatch&lt;/a&gt;. Sitting just outside of Andover, the track forms a large loop around the outside of an airfield. Spectators are permitted along the pit straight, the outside of Turn 1, and up to the Campbell-Cobb chicane, leaving maybe three quarters of the lap that’s only visible in the distance across the field. There are grass verges around all the viewing areas, providing plenty of space to set up camp with good views of the track even on busy days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thruxton_2.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best viewing was to be had from the two grandstands at the Club chicane. As well as providing the best views of the more remote regions of the circuit, the section of track between Woodham and the chicane itself was host to most of the racing action, including many overtakes and several crashes. On the day I visited, a seat in the grandstand would set you back a reasonable £6, bringing my total admission spend to £20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Saturday not being the main racing day, the cars on display provided solid entertainment with a few notable incidents. There was a big crash involving several cars at the end of the second Mini Challenge race, and a Formula 4 race was won by a car that controversially took the lead by skipping the chicane on the last lap (&lt;a href=&quot;http://fiaformula4.com/zagazeta-appeal-dismissed-gray-declared-winner-of-round-16/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which was later penalised&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thruxton_3.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was particularly interesting to see up close was the way the BTCC cars took some of the kerbs, hitting the strips so aggressively that cars often bounced up onto two wheels temporarily. Watching the race on the TV the next day, the commentators mentioned that this was discouraged by the tyre manufacturers and may have been responsible for some of the failures we saw, but it certainly added to the spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I’d say Thruxton was definitely worth the trip. The circuit doesn’t give you as many viewing angles as Brands Hatch and doesn’t feel quite so “interactive”, but the track - and in particular the Club chicane - certainly made for some exciting racing and provided an enjoyable and affordable day out.

And none of these is more frustrating than when you find yourself unable to assign a ship to a new sea line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are if you’ve stumbled across this article, you’ve been presented with the an error when trying to put the infrastructure in place to transport passengers or cargo across water. The messages vary, but will usually say something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_shipping_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Unable to find path to stop (no path for big ships). A path has been found, but only small ships are allowed on this path. Consider using small ships or large docks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused a fair bit of confusion when I first encountered it. What was this mysterious issue? Over time, I’ve found that this error can be caused by any of the following factors…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-waters-are-not-navigable&quot;&gt;The waters are not navigable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the solution can be as simple as checking that the water along your route is deep enough for the ship to travel through. That said, despite my initial suspicions, I don’t think this will often be the issue. After some testing, is appears that the game considers any depth at all navigable, even if I create an artifical, jagged seabed sits just below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to double-check is to use the Navigable Waters layer. Click the layers button in the top left and choose the icon that looks like waves. The game will colour all water that ships can travel through green, and this will help you to identify any trouble spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theres-a-bridge-in-the-way&quot;&gt;There’s a bridge in the way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low road and rail bridges can also present an obstruction to ships. Again, the easiest way to check this is by using the Navigable Waters layer. If your bridge has a blue area around it, you’ll need to demolish it and reconstruct it at a greater height in order to allow ships to pass underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_shipping_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theres-no-suitable-dock&quot;&gt;There’s no suitable dock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final reason why your route might be failing, and the one that caught me out first time round, is if you don’t have suitable docks at your ports for your ship to arrive and depart from. Ships come in two flavours in &lt;em&gt;Transport Fever 2&lt;/em&gt; - large and small - and there are docks to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a large dock for your large ship, click on the port, choose Configure, and select the large dock under either Passenger or Cargo. Place the dock, and then switch to the Landing tab and add the appropriate landing next to the dock. This should look something like the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tf2_shipping_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, make sure that your line is now using the correct landing. Open the Line Manager, look at the relevant port’s entry in the route, and click on the waves with the dock number next to them.

Chances are if you’ve stumbled across this article, you’ve been presented with the an error when trying to put the infrastructure in place to transport passengers or cargo across water. The messages vary, but will usually say something like this: “Unable to find path to stop (no path for big ships). A path has been found, but only small ships are allowed on this path. Consider using small ships or large docks.” This caused a fair bit of confusion when I first encountered it. What was this mysterious issue? Over time, I’ve found that this error can be caused by any of the following factors… The waters are not navigable Sometimes the solution can be as simple as checking that the water along your route is deep enough for the ship to travel through. That said, despite my initial suspicions, I don’t think this will often be the issue. After some testing, is appears that the game considers any depth at all navigable, even if I create an artifical, jagged seabed sits just below the surface. The easiest way to double-check is to use the Navigable Waters layer. Click the layers button in the top left and choose the icon that looks like waves. The game will colour all water that ships can travel through green, and this will help you to identify any trouble spots. There’s a bridge in the way Low road and rail bridges can also present an obstruction to ships. Again, the easiest way to check this is by using the Navigable Waters layer. If your bridge has a blue area around it, you’ll need to demolish it and reconstruct it at a greater height in order to allow ships to pass underneath. There’s no suitable dock The final reason why your route might be failing, and the one that caught me out first time round, is if you don’t have suitable docks at your ports for your ship to arrive and depart from. Ships come in two flavours in Transport Fever 2 - large and small - and there are docks to match. To add a large dock for your large ship, click on the port, choose Configure, and select the large dock under either Passenger or Cargo. Place the dock, and then switch to the Landing tab and add the appropriate landing next to the dock. This should look something like the image below. Finally, make sure that your line is now using the correct landing. Open the Line Manager, look at the relevant port’s entry in the route, and click on the waves with the dock number next to them.
