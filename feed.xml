While I wasn‚Äôt as keen on the typically violent ending, the picture the director painted of 1960s Los Angeles was captivating, perfectly complemented by the period soundtrack and Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt‚Äôs performances as an actor and his stunt double navigating the unforgiving world of Hollywood after the peak of their careers. How does a story so entwined with certain visuals and music translate to the written word - especially when said novelisation is the author‚Äôs debut? We found out in 2021, when Tarantino published a 400-page reworking he described as ‚Äúa complete rethinking of the entire story‚Äù. While it‚Äôs not terrible, I will say that I‚Äôm glad he gave us the film first, because the novel is not half as enthralling.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2025/01/31/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5" /><published>2025-01-31T00:00:01+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-31T00:00:01+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2025/01/31/forza-horizon-5-ps5</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="forza" /><category term="racing" /><category term="industry" /><summary type="html">üèÅ Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 this spring.

The standard price for games has already increased from ¬£50 to ¬£60 in recent years, and it has been speculated that GTA VI‚Äôs RRP could skyrocket all the way up to $100 (approximately ¬£80). That would already be a punch in the gut for gamers reeling from the rising cost of living and a faltering job market, but it‚Äôs one they might be able to stomach for GTA VI in particular. Rockstar has a track record for producing high-quality titles, with GTA V (2013) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) both receiving widespread acclaim.

A rough representation of the daydream The Pathless Path inspired for me When Millerd‚Äôs own corporate consulting career was disrupted by health issues, he gained a new outlook on life. He left New York and spent time in Asia, first working freelance consulting gigs before developing online training courses and writing more. He found himself in a far happier place as a result. He argues that too many people unquestioningly follow a default path, where regular raises and promotions make it easy to continue in an unfulfilling career and switch off the voice questioning your happiness. With sufficient coping strategies, Millerd says people can tolerate consistent misery almost indefinitely. But if not that, then what else? The Pathless Path prompts readers to discover what they would be if they weren‚Äôt simply workers. By identifying what you enjoy doing, you can work backwards to build a life around that - ideally one that leaves you happier and better serves the people and communities around you. It‚Äôs inspiring stuff. I often daydream about a future where I manage to make a living from a software as a service project, this blog, or some other creative endeavour. I have no doubt that I‚Äôd wake up with greater motivation each day if granted that kind of agency and freedom to focus on what interests me. Millerd would argue that freedom is already there, but few actually recognise or take advantage of it. However, The Pathless Path almost overlooks the biggest factor that chains most people to their desks for 40 hours per week - money. When the author left his corporate job, he managed to find income through freelance consulting and moved to Taiwan, where the cost of living is lower. He does mention that those on the pathless path must learn to view money differently, but his biggest obstacle through the book seems to be a fear of making a fool of himself, rather than dread of ending up completely broke. I have a family to support and a mortgage to pay, and if I left my traditional career, I‚Äôm not confident I‚Äôd be able to find enough customers to avoid whittling my savings down to nothing and being forced to return to the rat race. Of course, I might be surprised if I ever did try it, but it feels as though holding a tolerable nine-to-five job is a necessary sacrifice to ensure long-term stability. Therefore, The Pathless Path was more of an escapist read - something philosophically interesting that I‚Äôd be keen to try if the mortgage was paid off, I somehow came across a large sum of money, or a side project gained some momentum, but that didn‚Äôt provide a practical path from A to B for me. 3/5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-pathless-path_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-pathless-path_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy new year!

Playing Falling Tree Games‚Äô upcoming title, I realised I‚Äôd always thought that the action-packed parts of Grand Theft Auto roleplay cops‚Äô jobs looked quite fun, but that the amount of grinding and bureaucracy to navigate to get there put me off. Averno City looks slick and is densely populated The Nottingham-based developer‚Äôs new game does the opposite, putting the paperwork aside and focusing on action inspired by 80s and 90s cop movies. It leans heavy into stereotypes - the main character is a fresh academy graduate and the son of a legendary officer, and even in the short demo encounters all the skeptical colleagues, jaded veterans, and hints of corruption you‚Äôd expect. It would all feel a bit derivative if it didn‚Äôt come in a package so polished that it reassures you the designers know what they‚Äôre doing. While The Precinct is a fully 3D game, its angles and zoom levels are reminiscent of 2D GTA. Averno City, while small, is densely populated and atmospheric, and the whole thing is set to convincing voice actors and a pulsing retrowave soundtrack. Gameplay sees your cop head out on his beat to fight crime in all its forms, from ticketing illegally parked cars to pursuing bank robbers. The Precinct‚Äôs longevity could depend heavily on the variety here. Thankfully there‚Äôs a long list of potential crimes in the police handbook - I just hope there are plenty of substories and unique dialogue to avoid low-level crimes feeling like a grind over time. Drive or pilot well enough and you're granted the option to call in support However, that may not matter if action feels solid enough. Combat is mostly a one-button affair, and in my opinion much of the fun lies in the vehicles. The driving model supports the retro cop show vibe, enabling long sideways slides when arriving on the scene, and the demo even includes a helicopter chase. What sets The Precinct apart are its police mechanics. The handbook tells you how much force you can use in any particular situation, and what the penalty should be for the culprit. You need to abide by these or face the repercussions. Pursuits also present some interesting options, as you‚Äôll need to augment your own driving with tactical calls for backup from the rest of the force. I‚Äôll certainly be keeping an eye on The Precinct ahead of its to-be-announced 2025 release date. The strength of the story and variety in the scenarios remain to be seen, but if the full game is as polished and engaging as the short slice of action Fallen Tree Games offered in the demo, it could be an indie gem.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/the-precinct_1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/the-precinct_1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/11/18/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Half-Life 2&amp;#58; 20th Anniversary Documentary" /><published>2024-11-18T00:00:01+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-18T00:00:01+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/11/18/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="half-life" /><category term="retro" /><summary type="html">‚ò¢Ô∏è Can you believe that Half-Life 2 is 20 years old already?

In the words of its creator, Rainy Night Creations, the upcoming indie title promises ‚ÄúPlayStation generation, low-polygon 3D stealth action‚Äù, and its visual language so closely matches its muse that any screenshot could be mistaken for the original Metal Gear Solid. The inspiration for Spy Drops is instantly recognisable Playing the recently released demo, it‚Äôs clear this is also true of the overall mood. In the opening cut scene, a gravelly-voiced colonel briefs Ripley on her mission in a monologue peppered with acronyms, namechecking artificial intelligence and other common themes of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs iconic series. We‚Äôre yet to see enough to know whether this is just lip service, or if it amounts to a compelling plot. Gameplay closely mirrors the MGS formula, tasking the player with sneaking through levels using cover and darkness. I‚Äôm not sure the mechanic was at play during the demo, but the game‚Äôs website says stages will have randomly generated layouts, which should drastically increase replayability. Engaging with the enemy As you‚Äôd expect, Ripley encounters enemy guards on her missions. While hand-to-hand combat is an option, sneaking up and grabbing them presents the option to either neutralise or kill them. Before doing so, you can also interrogate them to gain what are essentially gameplay hints, which is a nice addition. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was ever challenged during the demo - even when approaching a guard directly from the front it was easy enough to subdue them before they did much damage, and my only death came via a mishap with a proximity mine (whose description claimed it couldn‚Äôt deal damage to the player character). Squint a little and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's 1998 Items in general are an area that could be improved for the full release. New items in MGS were sparse, and each had a specific purpose that was explained via Codec dialogue. Conversely, Spy Drops throws new equipment at you from all angles with little information on what each gadget does, and it‚Äôs not helped by a clunky interface that can make it a bit of a hassle to assign and equip gear. Promising signs The only misfire when it comes to atmopshere is some of the audio choices - guards sometimes sound as though they‚Äôre wearing stiletto heels, and have little to say beyond: ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù The music, while fitting the bill in terms of mood, is a short and imperfect loop that sometimes distracts from the action. I also encountered a few performance issues that I wouldn‚Äôt have expected from a low-poly game, with stutters between certainly scene changes and animations - although hopefully that‚Äôs something that can be optimised out before release. I remain optimistic for Spy Drops - I‚Äôve always daydreamed about what it might be like if somebody tried to emulate the Metal Gear Solid glory days, and this is already an amazing achievement for a one-man studio - but it remains to be seen how well the pieces will all fit together, and if it will successfully capture the tone and thematic elements that made the series so special.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/spy-drops_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/spy-drops_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
