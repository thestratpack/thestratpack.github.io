We‚Äôve witnessed one of the most remarkable failures ever, as Concord - the Firewalk Studios-developed live service game into which Sony had invested so much in the hope it would be the next big thing - was shut down after just two weeks in operation. Much of the criticism of the title was written off by its supporters and the press as ‚Äúhate‚Äù, but this story is actually a culmination of a number of factors that should not be swept under the carpet. If they are, then game developers and publishers might miss the important lessons that should be learnt from Concord‚Äôs demise.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concord_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concord_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Year In Between - my debut novel is available now!</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/02/the-year-in-between-novel" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Year In Between - my debut novel is available now!" /><published>2024-08-26T01:00:01+01:00</published><updated>2024-08-26T01:00:01+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/09/02/the-year-in-between-novel</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="the-year-in-between" /><category term="writing" /><category term="books" /><summary type="html">My first ever novel, The Year In Between, is now available for purchase!

Its writers said it was ‚Äúeasily 100 times more detailed‚Äù than the map of its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, concluding that altogether, the city was ‚Äúconvincingly like the real thing‚Äù. GTA IV tells story of Niko Bellic, but Liberty City has a life of its own It truly was like nothing we‚Äôd ever seen. Spanning three islands totalling just over six square miles, GTA IV‚Äôs map was nowhere near as expansive as the region depicted by Rockstar‚Äôs 2004 title, but it was perhaps the densest video game setting ever built in terms of population and detail - and certainly in character. For players focused on the story and the violence, many of the small touches that made Liberty City such a great virtual city probably passed by unnoticed. But even then, they undoubtedly felt that what they were playing was a premium product, even if they didn‚Äôt know why. My goal in this article is to pick apart those minutae that make GTA IV‚Äôs world such a compelling imitiation of a real-life city.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gta-iv_9.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gta-iv_9.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Notice anything different?</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/08/25/notice-anything-different" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Notice anything different?" /><published>2024-08-25T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/08/25/notice-anything-different</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">üé® Notice anything different?

That‚Äôs the rather unusual question presented by Heartbound, an Early Access game whose creator is also a streamer. But whether you‚Äôve caught Thor online or not, the indie game has plenty of intrigue to unpack in its own right. Heartbound has been a while in the making. The first version of the indie game was made available under Steam‚Äôs Early Access programme in December 2018, and its ironically-named developer Pirate Software - fronted by Jason Thor Hall - has been adding content as it‚Äôs become ready ever since. As of August 2024, the game currently consists of three of a planned five segments, one of which does not yet have an ending, and which take about three hours to play through altogether. Unusually, Thor streams his work on Twitch and YouTube, where he has a combined 3 million followers at the time of writing.

Combined, these factors can produce a unique state of mind, and I find that one of the most difficult parts of any trip where it arises is to properly observe and harness the new perspective that brings before it disappears once again under the tide of work and life admin. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working through the jet lag to type this out before the weekend is through. The trip itself ‚Äì another couple of weeks in Japan ‚Äì was fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable. I spent my time between the bustle of Tokyo and more rural parts of Hokkaido, packing in as much good food and karaoke as possible along the way. But wherever I am in Japan, my eye is always drawn back to the attention to detail and earnestness ingrained in its culture. This is demonstrated in everything from an elaborate shop window display to consideration for others in public spaces. Following my last visit, I wrote about the hospitality and curiosity of those I met on my travels. My return served as something of a follow-up meditation session, and offered a chance to further concentrate and expand upon those thoughts, and properly consider what use they might be to me in my regular life.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/japan_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/japan_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Notes from a brief stay in New York</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/04/16/notes-brief-stay-new-york-ny" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Notes from a brief stay in New York" /><published>2024-04-16T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-04-16T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/04/16/notes-brief-stay-new-york-ny</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="usa" /><summary type="html">I‚Äôm used to big cities. I‚Äôve lived in London for more than a decade and have spent time in various European capitals, Tokyo, Abu Dhabi, Las Vegas, and Austin. But as Manhattan emerged over the horizon on the cab ride from JFK Airport, I realised that none of these had prepared me for New York City, where the endless looming towers made each street feel as enclosed as the Midtown Tunnel. While New York has a heavy media presence - Friends, Seinfeld, Annie Hall, Ghostbusters, and so on - my strongest impression of the city came from its gritty representation in Grand Theft Auto IV. Liberty City seemed an impossible feat in 2008, and served as a kind of virtual tourist experience to escape the confines of my hometown. But returning to it after I got home, it was as though its scale had shrunk significantly while I was away, and it felt more game-like than ever before. The reason for this is that real-life Manhattan is not only bigger than I expected vertically, but also has a gigantic footprint. On my first full day, I decided to walk from where I was staying in the Financial District up to Central Park via various landmarks - what turned out to be nearly five miles through bustling, diverse districts that at once felt very similar to London and unmistakably foreign. Despite capturing the vibe well, Rockstar‚Äôs approximation feels like a small village by comparison.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/new-york_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/new-york_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Stellar Blade is a challenging and stylistic gaming nostalgia trip</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/04/01/stellar-blade-demo-review" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stellar Blade is a challenging and stylistic gaming nostalgia trip" /><published>2024-04-01T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-04-01T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/04/01/stellar-blade-demo-review</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="stellar-blade" /><category term="industry" /><summary type="html">The Stellar Blade demo is here! There are many adjectives that could be applied to Level Up‚Äôs much-discussed PlayStation 5 exclusive - beautiful, unique, gruesome, and challenging, to name a few - but for me, more than anything else, the upcoming action-adventure title is a nostalgia trip to previous eras of gaming. Back in the early 2000s, when I was a child, I didn‚Äôt have much of my own money for games. My purchases were gated by my parents, who knew nearly nothing about what was worth paying for, and my only gauge of quality was a review in the odd gaming magazine. Subsequently, box art and blurbs came into play, and there were some real wildcards in my collection that I asked for purely on a whim. Sometimes this paid off - games like Operation: WinBack and King of Bowling 2 were off the beaten path, hardly classics, but a lot of fun with friends. It was this blind experimentation that also led me to more praised games that I just hadn‚Äôt heard of through friends, like Smuggler‚Äôs Run and early Final Fantasy entries. Of course, other times I happened across the occasional stinker, but these were few and far between, and the sunk cost meant I stuck with most of my purchases anyway.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stellar-blade_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stellar-blade_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Apple Watch Series 8 review: You‚Äôll get it when you get one</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/03/10/apple-watch-series-8-review" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apple Watch Series 8 review&amp;#58; You'll get it when you get one" /><published>2024-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/03/10/apple-watch-series-8-review</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="reviews" /><category term="apple" /><category term="wearables" /><category term="running" /><summary type="html">I can‚Äôt remember a technology product I‚Äôve been so undecided on for so long as the Apple Watch. Since the first generation launched in 2015, I‚Äôve watched Apple‚Äôs iteration from afar, always unsure as to whether a smartwatch could ever provide enough benefit to warrant a price tag of at least a few hundred pounds. A lot of it came down to a question of intrusion - if I‚Äôve been working to reduce the number of notifications interrupting my life, why would I want them strapped to my wrist? But with certain changes approaching in my life that will put strain on my time management, I decided to give the Apple Watch a go to reduce the number of times I need to pick up my phone, while implementing measures to limit distractions. First, I would keep the number of notifications pushed to the watch to a minimum, and second, I would make much better use of Siri and the Shortcuts app to make it easier to retrieve the information I need most often without opening any apps.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-watch_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-watch_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sims (PC) retrospective</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2024/02/11/the-sims-retrospective" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sims (PC) retrospective" /><published>2024-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2024/02/11/the-sims-retrospective</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="the-sims" /><category term="strategy" /><category term="simulation" /><category term="retro" /><summary type="html">If you think of The Sims today, you‚Äôll likely think of the EA money printing machine and its endless conveyor belt of expansion and stuff packs.

That wasn‚Äôt always the case. When the original game was released in 2000, it did contain some humour (especially through Maxis‚Äôs renowned flavour text) but the game itself was an attempt to explore social and architectural themes through the most realistic recreation of life possible with the technology of the time ‚Äì and as a result of its limitations, one that often strays into unsettling territory.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-sims_4.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-sims_4.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
