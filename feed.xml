The main story sounds like a chore and I prefer immersive sim RPGs to its more static world, but I really enjoyed this week’s episode of The Besties, which covered some of the more innovative features Obsidian has brought to the table. These include speech checks more involved than “is X greater than Y”, and graceful, immersive dialogue when the player stumbles upon quest locations earlier than planned.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tsp.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sega and Sports Interactive were right to cancel Football Manager 25</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2025/02/11/football-manager-25-cancelled" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sega and Sports Interactive were right to cancel Football Manager 25" /><published>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2025/02/11/football-manager-25-cancelled</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="industry" /><category term="football-manager" /><summary type="html">If you read this blog regularly, you’ll likely agree that the games industry in 2025 is a Wild West of anti-consumer practices. Developers and publishers seem set on milking as much money from customers as possible, regardless of the damage done to beloved series or the reputations of the companies themselves. One unfortunate habit studios have developed is to release horribly broken games. Even if a title is obviously unfit for public consumption, they prefer to rake in gamers’ hard-earned cash now and worry about fixing the mess in later patches. Think Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Outlaws, or Cities: Skylines 2. Therefore the easy option would have been for Sega and Sports Interactive to sand off Football Manager 25’s rough edges and release it, and we should praise them for cancelling this year’s edition in favour of maintaining the series’ quality.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/football-manager-25_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/football-manager-25_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The government won’t protect your access to live service games</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2025/02/06/uk-government-live-service-petition" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The government won't protect your access to live service games" /><published>2025-02-06T00:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2025/02/06/uk-government-live-service-petition</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="industry" /><category term="gran-turismo" /><summary type="html">An attempt to protect gamers against publishers’ abrupt shuttering - or “sunsetting” - of live service games failed this week, after the government stated that there are “no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games”.

While I wasn’t as keen on the typically violent ending, the picture the director painted of 1960s Los Angeles was captivating, perfectly complemented by the period soundtrack and Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt’s performances as an actor and his stunt double navigating the unforgiving world of Hollywood after the peak of their careers. How does a story so entwined with certain visuals and music translate to the written word - especially when said novelisation is the author’s debut? We found out in 2021, when Tarantino published a 400-page reworking he described as “a complete rethinking of the entire story”. While it’s not terrible, I will say that I’m glad he gave us the film first, because the novel is not half as enthralling.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5</title><link href="https://stratpack.blog/2025/01/31/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5" /><published>2025-01-31T00:00:01+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-31T00:00:01+00:00</updated><id>https://stratpack.blog/2025/01/31/forza-horizon-5-ps5</id><author><name>thestratpack</name></author><category term="forza" /><category term="racing" /><category term="industry" /><summary type="html">🏁 Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 this spring.

The standard price for games has already increased from £50 to £60 in recent years, and it has been speculated that GTA VI’s RRP could skyrocket all the way up to $100 (approximately £80). That would already be a punch in the gut for gamers reeling from the rising cost of living and a faltering job market, but it’s one they might be able to stomach for GTA VI in particular. Rockstar has a track record for producing high-quality titles, with GTA V (2013) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) both receiving widespread acclaim.

A rough representation of the daydream The Pathless Path inspired for me When Millerd’s own corporate consulting career was disrupted by health issues, he gained a new outlook on life. He left New York and spent time in Asia, first working freelance consulting gigs before developing online training courses and writing more. He found himself in a far happier place as a result. He argues that too many people unquestioningly follow a default path, where regular raises and promotions make it easy to continue in an unfulfilling career and switch off the voice questioning your happiness. With sufficient coping strategies, Millerd says people can tolerate consistent misery almost indefinitely. But if not that, then what else? The Pathless Path prompts readers to discover what they would be if they weren’t simply workers. By identifying what you enjoy doing, you can work backwards to build a life around that - ideally one that leaves you happier and better serves the people and communities around you. It’s inspiring stuff. I often daydream about a future where I manage to make a living from a software as a service project, this blog, or some other creative endeavour. I have no doubt that I’d wake up with greater motivation each day if granted that kind of agency and freedom to focus on what interests me. Millerd would argue that freedom is already there, but few actually recognise or take advantage of it. However, The Pathless Path almost overlooks the biggest factor that chains most people to their desks for 40 hours per week - money. When the author left his corporate job, he managed to find income through freelance consulting and moved to Taiwan, where the cost of living is lower. He does mention that those on the pathless path must learn to view money differently, but his biggest obstacle through the book seems to be a fear of making a fool of himself, rather than dread of ending up completely broke. I have a family to support and a mortgage to pay, and if I left my traditional career, I’m not confident I’d be able to find enough customers to avoid whittling my savings down to nothing and being forced to return to the rat race. Of course, I might be surprised if I ever did try it, but it feels as though holding a tolerable nine-to-five job is a necessary sacrifice to ensure long-term stability. Therefore, The Pathless Path was more of an escapist read - something philosophically interesting that I’d be keen to try if the mortgage was paid off, I somehow came across a large sum of money, or a side project gained some momentum, but that didn’t provide a practical path from A to B for me. 3/5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-pathless-path_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stratpack.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-pathless-path_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy new year!
